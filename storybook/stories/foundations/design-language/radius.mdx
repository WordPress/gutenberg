# Radius

<img src={ radius } alt="Radius" width="100%" />

The radius scale is designed to provide a consistent, elegant appearance across nested elements. The defined values help maintain visual harmony between smaller primitives and larger containers, ensuring a cohesive user experience.

## Scale

The scale includes the following steps:

-   `radius-x-small`: Applied to the smallest elements, such as buttons inside inputs or similar small primitives. This ensures subtle rounding without distracting from the core design.
-   `radius-small`: The most commonly used radius value, applied to many primitives like buttons, inputs, and other standalone controls. It provides a moderate rounding that feels balanced and polished.
-   `radius-medium`: Used for medium-sized containers like dropdown menus, popovers, and other mid-level components. This value is slightly more pronounced, giving these elements a soft but noticeable edge.
-   `radius-large`: Reserved for larger containers such as cards and modals. The larger radius ensures that these elements have a smooth, elegant appearance that enhances their prominence on the page.
-   `radius-full`: Applies a `border-radius` of `9999px`, this value creates a highly rounded appearance, often used on pill-shaped buttons or other components where extreme rounding is desired but full circularity is not necessary.
-   `radius-round`: This value applies a `border-radius` of `100%`, making elements fully circular. It's typically used for circular avatars or buttons where complete rounding is required.

These steps are defined as tokens. To view the values and understand how to use them please view the [Tokens section](?path=/docs/tokens-radius--page).

## Usage Guidelines

-   Consistency: To maintain visual cohesion, adhere to the radius scale when styling elements. Avoid custom radius values unless there is a specific need.
-   Nested Elements: When combining elements of different sizes (e.g., buttons within inputs or cards within modals), ensure that smaller nested elements use the appropriate radius value for their size.
-   Accessibility: Larger radius values can create a more approachable and friendly appearance, especially for larger components like cards and modals that demand more attention from users.

      - Scale application of radius with element or container size.

      - Use `radius-round` for circles and `radius-full` for pills.

        -   Don't nest larger radii inside smaller radii.

        -   Don't apply the same
    radius value to container and immediate descendent.
