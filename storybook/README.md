# Storybook

Storybook is an open-source tool that provides a sandbox to develop and visualize components in isolation. See the [Storybook site](https://storybook.js.org/) for more information about the tool.

The Gutenberg project uses Storybook to view and work with the UI components developed in the WordPress packages.
