# Warning

Utility for warning messages to the console based on a passed condition.

## Installation

Install the module

```bash
npm install @wordpress/warning --save
```

_This package assumes that your code will run in an **ES2015+** environment. If you're using an environment that has limited or no support for such language features and APIs, you should include [the polyfill shipped in `@wordpress/babel-preset-default`](https://github.com/WordPress/gutenberg/tree/HEAD/packages/babel-preset-default#polyfill) in your code._

## Reducing bundle size

Literal strings aren't minified. Keeping them in your production bundle may increase the bundle size significantly.

To prevent that, you should:

1.  Put `@wordpress/warning/babel-plugin` into your [babel config](https://babeljs.io/docs/en/plugins#plugin-options) or use [`@wordpress/babel-preset-default`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@wordpress/babel-preset-default), which already includes the babel plugin.

    This will make sure your `warning` calls are wrapped within a condition that checks if `process.env.NODE_ENV !== 'production'`.

2.  Use [UglifyJS](https://github.com/mishoo/UglifyJS2), [Terser](https://github.com/terser/terser) or any other JavaScript parser that performs [dead code elimination](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dead_code_elimination). This is usually used in conjunction with JavaScript bundlers, such as [webpack](https://github.com/webpack/webpack).

    When parsing the code in `production` mode, the `warning` call will be removed altogether.
