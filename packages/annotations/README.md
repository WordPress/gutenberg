# Annotations

Annotate content in the Gutenberg editor.

## Installation

Install the module

```bash
npm install @wordpress/annotations --save
```

_This package assumes that your code will run in an **ES2015+** environment. If you're using an environment that has limited or no support for ES2015+ such as lower versions of IE then using [core-js](https://github.com/zloirock/core-js) or [@babel/polyfill](https://babeljs.io/docs/en/next/babel-polyfill) will add support for these methods. Learn more about it in [Babel docs](https://babeljs.io/docs/en/next/caveats)._

## Getting Started

You need to include `wp-annotations` as a dependency of the JavaScript file in which you wish to use the Annotations API.

## Usage

[See this page for more detailed usage instructions](https://developer.wordpress.org/block-editor/developers/block-api/block-annotations).
