# Element

Element is, quite simply, an abstraction layer atop [React](https://reactjs.org/).

You may find yourself asking, "Why an abstraction layer?". For a few reasons:

-   In many applications, especially those extended by a rich plugin ecosystem as is the case with WordPress, it's wise to create interfaces to underlying third-party code. The thinking is that if ever a need arises to change or even replace the underlying implementation, it can be done without catastrophic rippling effects to dependent code, so long as the interface stays the same.
-   It provides a mechanism to shield implementers by omitting features with uncertain futures (`createClass`, `PropTypes`).
-   It helps avoid incompatibilities between versions by ensuring that every plugin operates on a single centralized version of the code.

On the `wp.element` global object, you will find the following, ordered roughly by the likelihood you'll encounter it in your code:

-   [`createElement`](https://reactjs.org/docs/react-api.html#createelement)
-   [`render`](https://reactjs.org/docs/react-dom.html#render)

## Installation

Install the module

```bash
npm install @wordpress/element --save
```

_This package assumes that your code will run in an **ES2015+** environment. If you're using an environment that has limited or no support for such language features and APIs, you should include [the polyfill shipped in `@wordpress/babel-preset-default`](https://github.com/WordPress/gutenberg/tree/HEAD/packages/babel-preset-default#polyfill) in your code._

## Usage

Let's render a customized greeting into an empty element:

```html
<div id="greeting"></div>
<script>
	function Greeting( props ) {
		return wp.element.createElement(
			'span',
			null,
			'Hello ' + props.toWhom + '!'
		);
	}

	wp.element.render(
		wp.element.createElement( Greeting, { toWhom: 'World' } ),
		document.getElementById( 'greeting' )
	);
</script>
```

Refer to the [official React Quick Start guide](https://reactjs.org/docs/hello-world.html) for a more thorough walkthrough, in most cases substituting `React` and `ReactDOM` with `wp.element` in code examples.

## Why React?

At the risk of igniting debate surrounding any single "best" front-end framework, the choice to use any tool should be motivated specifically to serve the requirements of the system. In modeling the concept of a [block](/packages/blocks/README.md), we observe the following technical requirements:

-   An understanding of a block in terms of its underlying values (in the [random image example](/packages/blocks/README.md#example), a category)
-   A means to describe the UI of a block given these values

At its most basic, React provides a simple input / output mechanism. **Given a set of inputs ("props"), a developer describes the output to be shown on the page.** This is most elegantly observed in its [function components](https://reactjs.org/docs/components-and-props.html#functional-and-class-components). React serves the role of reconciling the desired output with the current state of the page.

The offerings of any framework necessarily become more complex as these requirements increase; many front-end frameworks prescribe ideas around page routing, retrieving and updating data, and managing layout. React is not immune to this, but the introduced complexity is rarely caused by React itself, but instead managing an arrangement of supporting tools. By moving these concerns out of sight to the internals of the system (WordPress core code), we can minimize the responsibilities of plugin authors to a small, clear set of touch points.

## JSX

While not at all a requirement to use React, [JSX](https://reactjs.org/docs/introducing-jsx.html) is a recommended syntax extension to compose elements more expressively. Through a build process, JSX is converted back to the `createElement` syntax you see earlier in this document.

If you've configured [Babel](http://babeljs.io/) for your project, you can opt in to JSX syntax by specifying the `pragma` option of the [`transform-react-jsx` plugin](https://www.npmjs.com/package/babel-plugin-transform-react-jsx) in your [`.babelrc` configuration](http://babeljs.io/docs/usage/babelrc/).

```json
{
	"plugins": [
		[
			"transform-react-jsx",
			{
				"pragma": "createElement"
			}
		]
	]
}
```

This assumes that you will import the `createElement` function in any file where you use JSX. Alternatively, consider using the [`@wordpress/babel-plugin-import-jsx-pragma` Babel plugin](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@wordpress/babel-plugin-import-jsx-pragma) to automate the import of this function.

_Returns_

-   `Array`: The concatenated value.

### createContext

Creates a context object containing two components: a provider and consumer.

_Parameters_

-   _defaultValue_ `Object`: A default data stored in the context.

_Returns_

-   `Object`: Context object.

### createElement

Returns a new element of given type. Type can be either a string tag name or
another function which itself returns an element.

_Parameters_

-   _type_ `?(string|Function)`: Tag name or element creator
-   _props_ `Object`: Element properties, either attribute set to apply to DOM node or values to pass through to element creator
-   _children_ `...WPElement`: Descendant elements

_Returns_

-   `WPElement`: Element.

### createInterpolateElement

This function creates an interpolated element from a passed in string with
specific tags matching how the string should be converted to an element via
the conversion map value.

_Usage_

For example, for the given string:

"This is a <span>string</span> with <a>a link</a> and a self-closing
<CustomComponentB/> tag"

You would have something like this as the conversionMap value:

```js
{
    span: <span />,
    a: <a href={ 'https://github.com' } />,
    CustomComponentB: <CustomComponent />,
}
```

_Parameters_

-   _interpolatedString_ `string`: The interpolation string to be parsed.
-   _conversionMap_ `Object`: The map used to convert the string to a react element.

_Returns_

-   `WPElement`: A wp element.

### createPortal

	native: __( 'Add media' ),
	web: __(
		'Drag images, upload new ones or select files from your library.'
	),
} );
```

### RawHTML

Component used as equivalent of Fragment with unescaped HTML, in cases where
it is desirable to render dangerous HTML without needing a wrapper element.
To preserve additional props, a `div` wrapper _will_ be created if any props
aside from `children` are passed.

_Parameters_

-   _props_ `RawHTMLProps`: Children should be a string of HTML or an array of strings. Other props will be passed through to the div wrapper.

_Returns_
