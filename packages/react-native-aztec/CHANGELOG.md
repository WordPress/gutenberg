For each user feature we should also add a importance categorization label  to indicate the relevance of the change for end users of GB Mobile. The format is the following:
[***] → Major new features, significant updates to core flows, or impactful fixes (e.g. a crash that impacts a lot of users) — things our users should be aware of.

[**] → Changes our users will probably notice, but doesn’t impact core flows. Most fixes.

[*] → Minor enhancements and fixes that address annoyances — things our users can miss.
