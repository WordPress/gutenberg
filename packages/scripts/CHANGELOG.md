## Master

### New Features

- The `build` and `start` commands supports simplified syntax for multiple entry points: `wp-scripts build entry-one.js entry-two.js` ([15982](https://github.com/WordPress/gutenberg/pull/15982)).

## 3.3.0 (2019-06-12)

### New Features

- The `lint-js` command lints now JS files in the entire project's directories by default ([15890](https://github.com/WordPress/gutenberg/pull/15890)).
- The `lint-pkg-json` command lints now `package.json` files in the entire project's directories by default ([15890](https://github.com/WordPress/gutenberg/pull/15890)).
- The `lint-style` command lints now CSS and SCSS files in the entire project's directories by default ([15890](https://github.com/WordPress/gutenberg/pull/15890)).
- The `lint-js`, `lint-pkg-json` and `lint-style` commands ignore now files located in `build` and `node_modules` folders by default ([15977](https://github.com/WordPress/gutenberg/pull/15977)).

## 3.2.0 (2019-05-21)

### New Feature

- Leverage `@wordpress/dependency-extraction-webpack-plugin` plugin to extract WordPress
  dependencies.
- The bundled `eslint` dependency has been updated from requiring `^5.12.1` to requiring `^5.16.0`.

### Enhancements

- The default Webpack configuration uses [`thread-loader`](https://github.com/webpack-contrib/thread-loader) to parallelize Babel processing.
- The default Webpack configuration now opts-in to [the `cacheDirectory` option](https://webpack.js.org/loaders/babel-loader/#options) for its Babel loader.
- The `source-map-loader` is excluded from production builds. This serves only as an optimization and should otherwise have no impact on build results.
