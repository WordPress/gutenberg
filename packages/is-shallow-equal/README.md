# Is Shallow Equal

A function for performing a shallow comparison between two objects or arrays. Two values have shallow equality when all of their members are strictly equal to the corresponding member of the other.

## Usage

The default export of `@wordpress/is-shallow-equal` is a function which accepts two objects or arrays:

```js
import isShallowEqual from '@wordpress/is-shallow-equal';

isShallowEqual( { a: 1 }, { a: 1, b: 2 } );
// ⇒ false

isShallowEqual( { a: 1 }, { a: 1 } );
// ⇒ true

isShallowEqual( [ 1 ], [ 1, 2 ] );
// ⇒ false

isShallowEqual( [ 1 ], [ 1 ] );
// ⇒ true
```

You can import a specific implementation if you already know the types of values you are working with:

```js
import { isShallowEqualArrays } from '@wordpress/is-shallow-equal';
import { isShallowEqualObjects } from '@wordpress/is-shallow-equal';
```

Shallow comparison differs from deep comparison by the fact that it compares members from each as being strictly equal to the other, meaning that arrays and objects will be compared by their _references_, not by their values (see also [_Object Equality in JavaScript_.](http://adripofjavascript.com/blog/drips/object-equality-in-javascript.html)) In situations where nested objects must be compared by value, consider using [Lodash's `isEqual`](https://lodash.com/docs/4.17.11#isEqual) instead.

```js
import isShallowEqual from '@wordpress/is-shallow-equal';
import { isEqual } from 'lodash'; // deep comparison

let object = { a: 1 };

isShallowEqual( [ { a: 1 } ], [ { a: 1 } ] );
// ⇒ false

isEqual( [ { a: 1 } ], [ { a: 1 } ] );
// ⇒ true

isShallowEqual( [ object ], [ object ] );
// ⇒ true
```

## Rationale

Shallow equality utilities are already a dime a dozen. Since these operations are often at the core of critical hot code paths, the WordPress contributors had specific requirements that were found to only be partially satisfied by existing solutions.

In particular, it should…

1. …consider non-primitive yet referentially-equal members values as equal.
   - Eliminates [`is-equal-shallow`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/is-equal-shallow) as an option.
2. …offer a single function through which to interface, regardless of value type.
   - Eliminates [`shallow-equal`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/shallow-equal) as an option.
3. …be barebones; only providing the basic functionality of shallow equality.
   - Eliminates [`shallow-equals`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/shallow-equals) as an option.
4. …anticipate and optimize for referential sameness as equal.
   - Eliminates [`is-equal-shallow`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/is-equal-shallow) and [`shallow-equals`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/shallow-equals) as options.
5. …be intended for use in non-Facebook projects.
   - Eliminates [`fbjs/lib/shallowEqual`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/fbjs) as an option.
6. …be the most performant implementation.
