## 9.13.0 (2023-10-05)

### Enhancements

-   Change implementation of `combineReducers` so that it doesn't use `eval` internally, and can run with a CSP policy that doesn't allow `unsafe-eval` ([#54606](https://github.com/WordPress/gutenberg/pull/54606)).

## 9.9.0 (2023-08-10)

### Bug Fixes

-   Update the type definitions for dispatched actions by accounting for Promisified return values and thunks. Previously, a dispatched action's return type was the same as the return type of the original action creator, which did not account for how dispatch works internally. (Plain actions get wrapped in a Promise, and thunk actions ultimately resolve to the innermost function's return type).
-   Update the type definition for dispatch() to handle string store descriptors correctly.

## 4.6.0 (2019-06-12)

### New Features

-   Expose `useSelect` hook for usage in functional components. ([#15737](https://github.com/WordPress/gutenberg/pull/15737))
-   Expose `useDispatch` hook for usage in functional components. ([#15896](https://github.com/WordPress/gutenberg/pull/15896))

### Enhancements

-   `withSelect` internally uses the new `useSelect` hook. ([#15737](https://github.com/WordPress/gutenberg/pull/15737). **Note:** This _could_ impact performance of code using `withSelect` in edge-cases. To avoid impact, memoize passed in `mapSelectToProps` callbacks or implement `useSelect` directly with dependencies.
-   `withDispatch` internally uses a new `useDispatchWithMap` hook (an internal only api) ([#15896](https://github.com/WordPress/gutenberg/pull/15896))

## 4.5.0 (2019-05-21)

### Bug Fixes

-   Restore functionality of action-generators returning a Promise. Clarify intent and behaviour for `dispatch` behaviour. Dispatch actions now always
    return a promise ([#14830](https://github.com/WordPress/gutenberg/pull/14830)

### Enhancements

-   Expose `hasResolver` property on returned selectors indicating whether the selector has a corresponding resolver.

## 4.3.0 (2019-03-06)

### Enhancements

-   The `registerStore` function now accepts an optional `initialState` option value.
-   Introduce new `invalidateResolutionForStore` dispatch action for signalling to invalidate the resolution cache for an entire given store.
-   Introduce new `invalidateResolutionForStoreSelector` dispatch action for signalling to invalidate the resolution cache for a store selector (and all variations of arguments on that selector).

### Bug Fixes

-   Resolves issue in the persistence plugin where passing `persist` as an array of reducer keys would wrongly replace state values for the unpersisted reducer keys.
-   Restores a behavior in the persistence plugin where a default state provided as an object will be deeply merged as a base for the persisted value. This allows for a developer to include additional new keys in a persisted value default in future iterations of their store.

## 4.2.0 (2019-01-03)

### Enhancements

-   Optimized performance of selector execution (~511% improvement)

## 4.1.0 (2018-12-12)

-   `withSelect`'s `mapSelectToProps` function takes the `registry` object as the 3rd param ([#11851](https://github.com/WordPress/gutenberg/pull/11851)).

-   `registry.registerReducer` has been deprecated. Use `registry.registerStore` instead.
-   `registry.registerSelectors` has been deprecated. Use `registry.registerStore` instead.
-   `registry.registerActions` has been deprecated. Use `registry.registerStore` instead.

-   The `loadAndPersist` function is removed. Use the persistence plugin instead.
-   `restrictPersistence`, `setPersistenceStorage` and `setupPersistence` functions have been removed. Please use the data persistence plugin instead.
-   Change how required built-ins are polyfilled with Babel 7 ([#9171](https://github.com/WordPress/gutenberg/pull/9171)). If you're using an environment that has limited or no support for ES2015+ such as lower versions of IE then using [core-js](https://github.com/zloirock/core-js) or [@babel/polyfill](https://babeljs.io/docs/en/next/babel-polyfill) will add support for these methods.
