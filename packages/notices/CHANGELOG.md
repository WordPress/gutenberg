### Breaking Change

- A notices message is no longer spoken as a result of notice creation, but rather by its display in the interface by its corresponding [`Notice` component](https://github.com/WordPress/gutenberg/tree/master/packages/components/src/notice).

## 1.5.0 (2019-06-12)

### New Features

- Support a new `snackbar` notice type in the `createNotice` action.

## 1.1.2 (2019-01-03)

## 1.1.1 (2018-12-12)

## 1.1.0 (2018-11-20)

### New Feature

- New option `speak` enables control as to whether the notice content is announced to screen readers (defaults to `true`)

### Bug Fixes

- While `createNotice` only explicitly supported content of type `string`, it was not previously enforced. This has been corrected.
