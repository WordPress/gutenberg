// The blocktype is the most important concept within the block API. It defines

// and `save`. The transforms specification allows converting one blocktype to
// another through formulas defined by either the source or the destination.
// Switching a blocktype is to be considered a one-way operation implying a
// transformation in the opposite way has to be handled explicitly.

// The block tree is composed of a collection of block nodes. Blocks contained
// within other blocks are called inner blocks. An important design
// consideration is that inner blocks are -- conceptually -- not part of the
// territory established by the parent block that contains them.
//
// This has multiple practical implications: when parsing, we can safely dispose
// of any block boundary found within a block from the innerHTML property when
// transfering to state. Not doing so would have a compounding effect on memory
// and uncertainty over the source of truth. This can be illustrated in how,
// given a tree of `n` nested blocks, the entry node would have to contain the
// actual content of each block while each subsequent block node in the state
// tree would replicate the entire chain `n-1`, meaning the extreme end node
// would have been replicated `n` times as the tree is traversed and would
// generate uncertainty as to which one is to hold the current value of the
// block. For composition, it also means inner blocks can effectively be child
// components whose mechanisms can be shielded from the `edit` implementation
// and just passed along.

// Validation is the process of comparing a block source with its output before
// there is any user input or interaction with a block. When this operation
// fails -- for whatever reason -- the block is to be considered invalid. As
// part of validating a block the system will attempt to run the source against
// any provided deprecation definitions.
//
// Worth emphasizing that validation is not a case of whether the markup is
// merely HTML spec-compliant but about how the editor knows to create such
// markup and that its inability to create an identical result can be a strong
// indicator of potential data loss (the invalidation is then a protective
// measure).
//
// The invalidation process can also be deconstructed in phases: 1) validate the
// block exists; 2) validate the source matches the output; 3) validate the
// source matches deprecated outputs; 4) work through the significance of
// differences. These are stacked in a way that favors performance and optimizes
// for the majority of cases. That is to say, the evaluation logic can become
// more sophisticated the further down it goes in the process as the cost is
// accounted for. The first logic checks have to be extremely efficient since
// they will be run for all valid and invalid blocks alike. However, once a
// block is detected as invalid -- failing the three first steps -- it is
// adequate to spend more time determining validity before throwing a conflict.

// Blocks are inherently indifferent about where the data they operate with ends
// up being saved. For example, all blocks can have a static and dynamic aspect
// to them depending on the needs. The static nature of a block is the `save()`
// definition that is meant to be serialized into HTML and which can be left
// void. Any block can also register a `render_callback` on the server, which
// makes its output dynamic either in part or in its totality.
//
// Child blocks are defined as a relationship that builds on top of the inner
// blocks mechanism. A child block is a block node of a particular type that can
// only exist within the inner block boundaries of a specific parent type. This
// allows block authors to compose specific blocks that are not meant to be used
// outside of a specified parent block context. Thus, child blocks extend the
// concept of inner blocks to support a more direct relationship between sets of
// blocks. The addition of parentâ€“child would be a subset of the inner block
// functionality under the premise that certain blocks only make sense as
// children of another block.
