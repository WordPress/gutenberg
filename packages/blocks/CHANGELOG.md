## 3.0.0 (Unreleased)

### Breaking Change

- The `isSharedBlock` function is removed. Use `isReusableBlock` instead.
- Change how required built-ins are polyfilled with Babel 7 ([#9171](https://github.com/WordPress/gutenberg/pull/9171)).  If you're using an environment that has limited or no support for ES2015+ such as lower versions of IE then using [core-js](https://github.com/zloirock/core-js) or [@babel/polyfill](https://babeljs.io/docs/en/next/babel-polyfill) will add support for these methods.

### Deprecations

- The `getDefaultBlockForPostFormat` function has been deprecated.
