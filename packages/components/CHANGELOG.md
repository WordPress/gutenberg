## v3.0.0 (Unreleased)

### Breaking Change

- `withAPIData` has been removed. Please use the Core Data module or `@wordpress/api-fetch` directly instead.
- `wp.components.Draggable` as a DOM node drag handler has been deprecated. Please, use `wp.components.Draggable` as a wrap component for your DOM node drag handler.

### New Feature

- Adding a new `AccessibleSVG` component.
