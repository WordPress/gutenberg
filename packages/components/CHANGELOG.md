## Master

### New Features

- Added a new `popoverProps` prop to the `Dropdown` component which allows users of the `Dropdown` component to pass props directly to the `PopOver` component.

### Bug Fixes

- The `Button` component will no longer assign default styling (`is-default` class) when explicitly assigned as primary (the `isPrimary` prop). This should resolve potential conflicts affecting a combination of `isPrimary`, `isDefault`, and `isLarge` / `isSmall`, where the busy animation would appear with incorrect coloring.

## 8.0.0 (2019-06-12)

### New Feature

- Add new `BlockQuotation` block to the primitives folder to support blockquote in a multiplatform way. [#15482](https://github.com/WordPress/gutenberg/pull/15482).
- `DropdownMenu` now supports passing a [render prop](https://reactjs.org/docs/render-props.html#using-props-other-than-render) as children for more advanced customization.

### Internal

- `MenuGroup` no longer uses `NavigableMenu` internally. It needs to be explicitly wrapped with `NavigableMenu` to bring back the same behavior.

### Documentation

- Added missing documentation for `DropdownMenu` props `menuLabel`, `position`, `className`.

### Breaking Change

- `ServerSideRender` is no longer part of components. It was extracted to an independent package `@wordpress/server-side-render`.

### Bug Fix

- Although `DateTimePicker` does not allow picking the seconds, passed the current seconds as the selected value for seconds when calling `onChange`. Now it passes zero.

### Bug fixes

- Fix `instanceId` prop passed through to `Button` component via `MenuItems` producing React console error. Fixed by removing the unnecessary use of `withInstanceId` on the `MenuItems` component [#14599](https://github.com/WordPress/gutenberg/pull/14599)

## 7.1.0 (2019-03-06)
