# Component Reference

This package includes a library of generic WordPress components to be used for creating common UI elements shared between screens and features of the WordPress dashboard.

## Installation

```bash
npm install @wordpress/components --save
```

_This package assumes that your code will run in an **ES2015+** environment. If you're using an environment that has limited or no support for such language features and APIs, you should include [the polyfill shipped in `@wordpress/babel-preset-default`](https://github.com/WordPress/gutenberg/tree/HEAD/packages/babel-preset-default#polyfill) in your code._

## Usage

Within Gutenberg, these components can be accessed by importing from the `components` root directory:

```jsx
/**
 * WordPress dependencies
 */
import { Button } from '@wordpress/components';

export default function MyButton() {
	return <Button>Click Me!</Button>;
}
```

Many components include CSS to add styles, which you will need to load in order for them to appear correctly. Within WordPress, add the `wp-components` stylesheet as a dependency of your plugin's stylesheet. See [wp_enqueue_style documentation](https://developer.wordpress.org/reference/functions/wp_enqueue_style/#parameters) for how to specify dependencies.

In non-WordPress projects, link to the `build-style/style.css` file directly, it is located at `node_modules/@wordpress/components/build-style/style.css`.

### Popovers

By default, the `Popover` component will render within an extra element appended to the body of the document.

If you want to precisely contol where the popovers render, you will need to use the `Popover.Slot` component.

The following example illustrates how you can wrap a component using a
`Popover` and have those popovers render to a single location in the DOM.

```jsx
/**
 * External dependencies
 */
import { Popover, SlotFillProvider } from '@wordpress/components';

/**
 * Internal dependencies
 */
import { MyComponentWithPopover } from './my-component';

const Example = () => {
	<SlotFillProvider>
		<MyComponentWithPopover />
		<Popover.Slot />
	</SlotFillProvider>;
};
```

### TypeScript

This package exposes its own types for the components it exports, however it doesn't export its own types for component props. If you need to extract the props type, please use `React.ComponentProps` to get the types from the element.

```tsx
import type { ComponentProps } from 'react';
import { Button } from '@wordpress/components';

export default function MyButton( props: ComponentProps< typeof Button > ) {
	return <Button { ...props }>Click Me!</Button>;
}
```
