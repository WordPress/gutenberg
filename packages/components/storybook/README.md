# Storybook 

Storybook is an open-source tool that provides a sandbox to develop and visualize components in isolation. See the [Storybookjs site](https://storybook.js.org/) for more information about the tool. 

The Gutenberg project uses Storybook to view and work the the `@wordpress/components` package.

View online at: https://wordpress.github.io/gutenberg/design-system/components

Run locally in your development environment running: `npm run design-system:dev` from the top-level Gutenberg directory.
