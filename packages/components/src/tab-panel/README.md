# TabPanel

TabPanel is a React component to render an ARIA-compliant TabPanel. 

TabPanels organize content across different screens, data sets, and interactions. It has two sections: a list of tabs, and the view to show when tabs are chosen.

### Usage

TabPanels organize and allow navigation between groups of content that are related and at the same level of hierarchy.

#### Tabs in a set
As a set, all tabs are unified by a shared topic. For clarity, each tab should contain content that is distinct from all the other tabs in a set. 

### Anatomy

2. Active text label
3. Active tab indicator
4. Inactive text label
5. Tab item

#### Labels

Tab labels appear in a single row, in the same typeface and size. Use text labels that clearly and succinctly describe the content of a tab, and make sure that a set of tabs contains a cohesive group of items that share a common characteristic.

Tab labels can wrap to a second line, but do not add a second row of tabs.

#### Active tab indicators

To differentiate an active tab from an inactive tab, apply an underline and color change to the active tab’s text and icon.

### Behavior

Users can navigate between tabs by tapping the tab key on the keyboard.

### Placement

Place tabs above content. Tabs control the UI region displayed below them.

## Development guidelines

### Usage

```jsx
import { TabPanel } from '@wordpress/components';

const onSelect = ( tabName ) => {
	console.log( 'Selecting tab', tabName );
};

const MyTabPanel = () => (
	<TabPanel className="my-tab-panel"
		activeClass="active-tab"
		onSelect={ onSelect }
		tabs={ [
			{
				name: 'tab1',
				title: 'Tab 1',
				className: 'tab-one',
			},
			{
				name: 'tab2',
				title: 'Tab 2',
				className: 'tab-two',
			},
		] }>
		{
			( tab ) => <p>{ tab.title }</p>
		}
	</TabPanel>
);
```
