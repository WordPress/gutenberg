# `Composite`

<div class="callout callout-alert">
This feature is still experimental. “Experimental” means this is an early implementation subject to drastic and breaking changes.
</div>

`Composite` provides a single tab stop on the page and allows navigation through the focusable descendants with arrow keys. This abstract component is based on the [WAI-ARIA Composite Role⁠](https://w3c.github.io/aria/#composite).

## Usage

```jsx
import { Composite, useCompositeStore } from '@wordpress/components';

const store = useCompositeStore();
<Composite store={store}>
  <Composite.Group>
    <Composite.GroupLabel>Label</Composite.GroupLabel>
    <Composite.Item>Item 1</Composite.Item>
    <Composite.Item>Item 2</Composite.Item>
  </CompositeGroup>
</Composite>
```

## Hooks

### `useCompositeStore`

Creates a composite store.

#### Props

##### `activeId`: `string | null`

The current active item `id`. The active item is the element within the composite widget that has either DOM or virtual focus (in case the `virtualFocus` prop is enabled).

-   `null` represents the base composite element (the one with a [composite role](https://w3c.github.io/aria/#composite)). Users will be able to navigate out of it using arrow keys.
-   If `activeId` is initially set to `null`, the base composite element itself will have focus and users will be able to navigate to it using arrow keys.

-   Required: no

##### `defaultActiveId`: `string | null`

The composite item id that should be active by default when the composite widget is rendered. If `null`, the composite element itself will have focus and users will be able to navigate to it using arrow keys. If `undefined`, the first enabled item will be focused.

-   Required: no

##### `setActiveId`: `((activeId: string | null | undefined) => void)`

A callback that gets called when the `activeId` state changes.

-   Required: no

##### `focusLoop`: `boolean | 'horizontal' | 'vertical' | 'both'`

Determines how the focus behaves when the user reaches the end of the composite widget.

On one-dimensional composite widgets:

-   `true` loops from the last item to the first item and vice-versa.
-   `horizontal` loops only if `orientation` is `horizontal` or not set.
-   `vertical` loops only if `orientation` is `vertical` or not set.
-   If `activeId` is initially set to `null`, the composite element will be focused in between the last and first items.

On two-dimensional composite widgets (ie. when using `CompositeRow`):

-   `true` loops from the last row/column item to the first item in the same row/column and vice-versa. If it's the last item in the last row, it moves to the first item in the first row and vice-versa.
-   `horizontal` loops only from the last row item to the first item in the same row.
-   `vertical` loops only from the last column item to the first item in the column row.
-   If `activeId` is initially set to `null`, vertical loop will have no effect as moving down from the last row or up from the first row will focus on the composite element.
-   If `focusWrap` matches the value of `focusLoop`, it'll wrap between the last item in the last row or column and the first item in the first row or column and vice-versa.

-   Required: no
-   Default: `false`

##### `focusShift`: `boolean`

**Works only on two-dimensional composite widgets**.

If enabled, moving up or down when there's no next item or when the next item is disabled will shift to the item right before it.

-   Required: no
-   Default: `false`

##### `focusWrap`: `boolean`

**Works only on two-dimensional composite widgets**.

If enabled, moving to the next item from the last one in a row or column
will focus on the first item in the next row or column and vice-versa.

-   `true` wraps between rows and columns.
-   `horizontal` wraps only between rows.
-   `vertical` wraps only between columns.
-   If `focusLoop` matches the value of `focusWrap`, it'll wrap between the
    last item in the last row or column and the first item in the first row or
    column and vice-versa.

-   Required: no
-   Default: `false`

##### `virtualFocus`: `boolean`

If enabled, the composite element will act as an [`aria-activedescendant`](https://www.w3.org/WAI/ARIA/apg/practices/keyboard-interface/#kbd_focus_activedescendant)
container instead of [roving tabindex](https://www.w3.org/WAI/ARIA/apg/practices/keyboard-interface/#kbd_roving_tabindex). DOM focus will remain on the composite element while its items receive
virtual focus.

In both scenarios, the item in focus will carry the `data-active-item` attribute.

-   Required: no
-   Default: `false`

##### `orientation`: `'horizontal' | 'vertical' | 'both'`

Defines the orientation of the composite widget. If the composite has a single row or column (one-dimensional), the `orientation` value determines which arrow keys can be used to move focus:

-   `both`: all arrow keys work.
-   `horizontal`: only left and right arrow keys work.
-   `vertical`: only up and down arrow keys work.

It doesn't have any effect on two-dimensional composites.

-   Required: no
-   Default: `both`

##### `rtl`: `boolean`

Determines how the `store`'s `next` and `previous` functions will behave. If `rtl` is set to `true`, they will be inverted.

This only affects the composite widget behavior. You still need to set `dir="rtl"` on HTML/CSS.

-   Required: no
-   Default: `false`

## Components

### `Composite`

Renders a composite widget.

#### Props

##### `store`: `CompositeStore<CompositeStoreItem>`

Object returned by the `useCompositeStore` hook.

-   Required: yes

##### `render`: `RenderProp<React.HTMLAttributes<any> & { ref?: React.Ref<any> | undefined; }> | React.ReactElement<any, string | React.JSXElementConstructor<any>>`

Allows the component to be rendered as a different HTML element or React component. The value can be a React element or a function that takes in the original component props and gives back a React element with the props merged.

-   Required: no

##### `focusable`: `boolean`

Makes the component a focusable element. When this element gains keyboard focus, it gets a `data-focus-visible` attribute and triggers the `onFocusVisible` prop.

The component supports the `disabled` prop even for those elements not supporting the native `disabled` attribute. Disabled elements may be still accessible via keyboard by using the the `accessibleWhenDisabled` prop.

Non-native focusable elements will lose their focusability entirely. However, native focusable elements will retain their inherent focusability.

-   Required: no

##### `disabled`: `boolean`

Determines if the element is disabled. This sets the `aria-disabled` attribute accordingly, enabling support for all elements, including those that don't support the native `disabled` attribute.

This feature can be combined with the `accessibleWhenDisabled` prop to
make disabled elements still accessible via keyboard.

**Note**: For this prop to work, the `focusable` prop must be set to
`true`, if it's not set by default.

-   Required: no
-   Default: `false`

##### `accessibleWhenDisabled`: `boolean`

Indicates whether the element should be focusable even when it is
`disabled`.

This is important when discoverability is a concern. For example:

> A toolbar in an editor contains a set of special smart paste functions
> that are disabled when the clipboard is empty or when the function is not
> applicable to the current content of the clipboard. It could be helpful to
> keep the disabled buttons focusable if the ability to discover their
> functionality is primarily via their presence on the toolbar.

controls](https://www.w3.org/WAI/ARIA/apg/practices/keyboard-interface/#focusabilityofdisabledcontrols).

-   Required: no

##### `onFocusVisible`: `(event: SyntheticEvent<HTMLElement>) => void`

Custom event handler invoked when the element gains focus through keyboard interaction or a key press occurs while the element is in focus. This is the programmatic equivalent of the `data-focus-visible` attribute.

**Note**: For this prop to work, the `focusable` prop must be set to `true` if it's not set by default.

-   Required: no

##### `children`: `React.ReactNode`

The contents of the component.

-   Required: no

### `Composite.Group`

Renders a group element for composite items.

##### `render`: `RenderProp<React.HTMLAttributes<any> & { ref?: React.Ref<any> | undefined; }> | React.ReactElement<any, string | React.JSXElementConstructor<any>>`

Allows the component to be rendered as a different HTML element or React component. The value can be a React element or a function that takes in the original component props and gives back a React element with the props merged.

-   Required: no

##### `children`: `React.ReactNode`

The contents of the component.

-   Required: no

### `Composite.GroupLabel`

Renders a label in a composite group. This component must be wrapped with `Composite.Group` so the `aria-labelledby` prop is properly set on the composite group element.

##### `render`: `RenderProp<React.HTMLAttributes<any> & { ref?: React.Ref<any> | undefined; }> | React.ReactElement<any, string | React.JSXElementConstructor<any>>`

Allows the component to be rendered as a different HTML element or React component. The value can be a React element or a function that takes in the original component props and gives back a React element with the props merged.

-   Required: no

##### `children`: `React.ReactNode`

The contents of the component.

-   Required: no

### `Composite.Item`

Renders a composite item.

##### `accessibleWhenDisabled`: `boolean`

Indicates whether the element should be focusable even when it is
`disabled`.

This is important when discoverability is a concern. For example:

> A toolbar in an editor contains a set of special smart paste functions
> that are disabled when the clipboard is empty or when the function is not
> applicable to the current content of the clipboard. It could be helpful to
> keep the disabled buttons focusable if the ability to discover their
> functionality is primarily via their presence on the toolbar.

-   Required: no

##### `children`: `React.ReactNode`

The contents of the component.

-   Required: no

### `Composite.Row`

Renders a composite row. Wrapping `Composite.Item` elements within `Composite.Row` will create a two-dimensional composite widget, such as a grid.

##### `render`: `RenderProp<React.HTMLAttributes<any> & { ref?: React.Ref<any> | undefined; }> | React.ReactElement<any, string | React.JSXElementConstructor<any>>`

-   Required: no

##### `children`: `React.ReactNode`

The contents of the component.

-   Required: no

### `Composite.Hover`

Renders an element in a composite widget that receives focus on mouse move and loses focus to the composite base element on mouse leave. This should be combined with the `Composite.Item` component.

##### `render`: `RenderProp<React.HTMLAttributes<any> & { ref?: React.Ref<any> | undefined; }> | React.ReactElement<any, string | React.JSXElementConstructor<any>>`

Allows the component to be rendered as a different HTML element or React component. The value can be a React element or a function that takes in the original component props and gives back a React element with the props merged.

-   Required: no

##### `children`: `React.ReactNode`

The contents of the component.

-   Required: no

### `Composite.Typeahead`

Renders a component that adds typeahead functionality to composite components. Hitting printable character keys will move focus to the next composite item that begins with the input characters.

##### `render`: `RenderProp<React.HTMLAttributes<any> & { ref?: React.Ref<any> | undefined; }> | React.ReactElement<any, string | React.JSXElementConstructor<any>>`

Allows the component to be rendered as a different HTML element or React component. The value can be a React element or a function that takes in the original component props and gives back a React element with the props merged.

-   Required: no

##### `children`: `React.ReactNode`

The contents of the component.

-   Required: no

### `Composite.Context`

The React context used by the composite components. It can be used by to access the composite store, and to forward the context when composite sub-components are rendered across portals (ie. `SlotFill` components) that would not otherwise forward the context to the `Fill` children.
