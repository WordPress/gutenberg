### Usage

#### When to use TextControls

TextControls are best used for free text entry. If you have a set of predefined options you want users to select from, it’s best to use a more constrained component, such as a SelectControl, RadioControl, CheckboxControl, or RangeControl.

Because TextControls are single-line fields, they are not suitable for collecting long responses. For those, use a text area instead.

TextControls should:

- Stand out and indicate that users can input information.
- Have clearly differentiated states (selected/unselected, active/inactive).
- Make it easy to understand the requested information and to address any errors.
- Have visible labels; placeholder text is not an acceptable replacement for a label as it vanishes when users start typing.

### Anatomy

1. Label
2. Input container
3. Input text

#### Label text
Label text is used to inform users as to what information is requested for a text field. Every text field should have a label. Label text should be above the input field, and always visible. 

#### Containers
Containers improve the discoverability of text fields by creating contrast between the text field and surrounding content.

**Do** 
A stroke around the container clearly indicates that users can input information.

![A TextControl without a clear visual marker to indicate the input area](https://make.wordpress.org/design/files/2019/03/TextControl-Dont.png)

**Don’t** 
Don’t use unclear visual markers to indicate a text field.

## Development guidelines

        className: '',
    } )( ( { className, setState } ) => ( 
        <TextControl
            label="Additional CSS Class"
            value={ className }
            onChange={ ( className ) => setState( { className } ) }
        />
    ) );
