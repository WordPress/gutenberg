# DateTimePicker

DateTimePicker is a React component to render a calendar and clock for selecting a date and time. The calendar and clock components can be accessed individually using the `DatePicker` and `TimePicker` components respectively.

## Usage

Render a DateTimePicker.

```jsx
import { DateTimePicker } from '@wordpress/components';
import { __experimentalGetSettings } from '@wordpress/date';
import { withState } from '@wordpress/compose';

const MyDateTimePicker = withState( {
	date: new Date(),
} )( ( { date, setState } ) => {
	const settings = __experimentalGetSettings();

	// To know if the current timezone is a 12 hour time with look for an "a" in the time format.
	// We also make sure this a is not escaped by a "/".
	const is12HourTime = /a(?!\\)/i.test(
		settings.formats.time
			.toLowerCase() // Test only the lower case a
			.replace( /\\\\/g, '' ) // Replace "//" with empty strings
			.split( '' ).reverse().join( '' ) // Reverse the string and test for "a" not followed by a slash
	);

	return (
		<DateTimePicker
			currentDate={ date }
			onChange={ ( date ) => setState( { date } ) }
			is12Hour={ is12HourTime }
		/>
	);
} );
```

## Props

The component accepts the following props:
