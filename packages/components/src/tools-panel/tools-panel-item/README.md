# ToolsPanelItem

<div class="callout callout-alert">
This feature is still experimental. “Experimental” means this is an early
implementation subject to drastic and breaking changes.

<br />

This component acts as a wrapper and controls the display of items to be contained
within a ToolsPanel. An item is displayed if it is flagged as a default control
or the corresponding panel menu item, provided via context, is toggled on for
this item.

## Usage

See [`tools-panel/README.md#usage`](/packages/components/src/tools-panel/tools-panel/)
for how to use `ToolsPanelItem`.

## Props

### `hasValue`: `() => boolean`

This is called when building the `ToolsPanel` menu to determine the item's
initial checked state.

-   Required: Yes

### `isShownByDefault`: `boolean`

This prop identifies the current item as being displayed by default. This means
it will show regardless of whether it has a value set or is toggled on in the
panel's menu.

-   Required: No
-   Default: `false`

### `label`: `string`

The supplied label is dual purpose.
It is used as:

1. the human-readable label for the panel's dropdown menu
2. a key to locate the corresponding item in the panel's menu context to
   determine if the panel item should be displayed.

A panel item's `label` should be unique among all items within a single panel.

-   Required: Yes

### `onDeselect`: `() => void`

Called when this item is deselected in the `ToolsPanel` menu. This is normally
used to reset the panel item control's value.

-   Required: No

### `onSelect`: `() => void`

A callback to take action when this item is selected in the `ToolsPanel` menu.

-   Required: No

### `panelId`: `string | null`

Panel items will ensure they are only registering with their intended panel by
comparing the `panelId` props set on both the item and the panel itself, or if the `panelId` is explicitly `null`. This
allows items to be injected from a shared source.

-   Required: No

### `resetAllFilter`: `( attributes?: any ) => any`

A `ToolsPanel` will collect each item's `resetAllFilter` and pass an array of
these functions through to the panel's `resetAll` callback. They can then be
iterated over to perform additional tasks.

-   Required: No
-   Default: `() => {}`
