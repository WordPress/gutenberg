# Guide

`Guide` is a React component that renders a _user guide_ in a modal. The guide consists of several pages which the user can step through one by one. The guide is finished when the modal is closed or when the user clicks _Finish_ on the last page of the guide.

## Usage

```jsx
function MyTutorial() {
	const [ isOpen, setIsOpen ] = useState( true );

	if ( ! isOpen ) {
		return null;
	}

	return (
		<Guide
			onFinish={ () => setIsOpen( false ) }
			pages={ [
				{
					content: <p>Welcome to the ACME Store!</p>,
				},
				{
					image: <img src="https://acmestore.com/add-to-cart.png" />,
					content: (
						<p>
							Click <i>Add to Cart</i> to buy a product.
						</p>
					),
				},
			] }
		/>
	);
}
```
