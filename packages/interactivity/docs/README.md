# Interactivity API Docs

👋 Hi! Welcome to the Interactivity API documentation.


> Interactivity API is a current [proposal](https://make.wordpress.org/core/2023/03/30/proposal-the-interactivity-api-a-better-developer-experience-in-building-interactive-blocks/) that **is only available in Gutenberg** at the moment and not in WordPress Core as it is still very experimental, and very likely to change.

> As part of an [Open Source project](https://developer.wordpress.org/block-editor/getting-started/faq/#the-gutenberg-project) we encourage participation in helping shape this API and its Docs. The [discussions](https://github.com/WordPress/gutenberg/discussions/categories/interactivity-api) and [issues](https://github.com/WordPress/gutenberg/labels/%5BFeature%5D%20Interactivity%20API) in GitHub are the best place to engage.


## Quick start

The best place to start with the Interactivity API is this [**Getting started guide**](1-getting-started.md). There you'll will find a very quick start guide and the current requirements of the Interactivity API.

## Take a deep dive

At the [**API Reference**](2-api-reference.md) page you'll find detailed technical descriptions for the *Directives* and *Store* which are the main elements of the Interactivity API.

You can also check [Getting Started - and other learning resources](https://github.com/WordPress/gutenberg/discussions/52894) among other [discussions in GitHub](https://github.com/WordPress/gutenberg/discussions/categories/interactivity-api) to learn more on this proposal.

## Get Involved

Feel free to open pull requests to improve any part of these docs, or to add other sections or files to the docs.
