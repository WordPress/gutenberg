> **This block requires Gutenberg 16.2 or superior to work**. The Interactivity API is, at the moment, not part of WordPress Core as it is still very experimental, and very likely to change. 

> **Note**
> This block uses the API shared at [Proposal: The Interactivity API – A better developer experience in building interactive blocks](https://make.wordpress.org/core/2023/03/30/proposal-the-interactivity-api-a-better-developer-experience-in-building-interactive-blocks/).
