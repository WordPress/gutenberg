# DataViews

DataViews is a component that provides an API to render datasets using different types of layouts (table, grid, list, etc.).

## Installation

Install the module

```bash
npm install @wordpress/dataviews --save
```

## Usage

```jsx
const Example = () => {
	// Declare data, fields, etc.

	return (
		<DataViews
			data={ data }
			fields={ fields }
			view={ view }
			onChangeView={ onChangeView }
			defaultLayouts={ defaultLayouts }
			actions={ actions }
			paginationInfo={ paginationInfo }
		/>
	);
};
```

<div class="callout callout-info">At <a href="https://wordpress.github.io/gutenberg/">WordPress Gutenberg's Storybook</a> there's and <a href="https://wordpress.github.io/gutenberg/?path=/docs/dataviews-dataviews--docs">example implementation of the Dataviews component</a></div>

## Properties

### `data`: `Object[]`

The dataset to work with, represented as a one-dimensional array.

Example:

```js
const data = [
	{
		id: 1,
		title: 'Title',
		author: 'Admin',
		date: '2012-04-23T18:25:43.511Z',
	},
	{
		/* ... */
	},
];
```

By default, dataviews would use each record's `id` as an unique identifier. If it's not, the consumer should provide a `getItemId` function that returns one.

### `fields`: `Object[]`

The fields describe the visible items for each record in the dataset.

Example:

```js
const STATUSES = [
	{ value: 'draft', label: __( 'Draft' ) },
	{ value: 'future', label: __( 'Scheduled' ) },
	{ value: 'pending', label: __( 'Pending Review' ) },
	{ value: 'private', label: __( 'Private' ) },
	{ value: 'publish', label: __( 'Published' ) },
	{ value: 'trash', label: __( 'Trash' ) },
];
const fields = [
	{
		id: 'title',
		label: 'Title',
		enableHiding: false,
	},
	{
		id: 'date',
		label: 'Date',
		render: ( { item } ) => {
			return <time>{ getFormattedDate( item.date ) }</time>;
		},
	},
	{
		id: 'author',
		label: __( 'Author' ),
		render: ( { item } ) => {
			return <a href="...">{ item.author }</a>;
		},
		elements: [
			{ value: 1, label: 'Admin' },
			{ value: 2, label: 'User' },
		],
		filterBy: {
			operators: [ 'is', 'isNot' ],
		},
		enableSorting: false,
	},
	{
		label: __( 'Status' ),
		id: 'status',
		getValue: ( { item } ) =>
			STATUSES.find( ( { value } ) => value === item.status )?.label ??
			item.status,
		elements: STATUSES,
		filterBy: {
			operators: [ 'isAny' ],
		},
		enableSorting: false,
	},
];
```

Each field is an object with the following properties:

-   `id`: identifier for the field. Unique.
-   `label`: the field's name to be shown in the UI.
-   `getValue`: function that returns the value of the field, defaults to `field[id]`.
-   `render`: function that renders the field. Optional, `getValue` will be used if `render` is not defined.
-   <code id="fields-elements">elements</code>: The list of options to pick from when using the field as a filter or when editing (DataForm component). It expects an array of objects with the following properties:

    -   `value`: The id of the value to filter to (for internal use)
    -   `label`: The text that will be displayed in the UI for the item.
    -   `description`: A longer description that describes the element, to also be displayed. Optional.

    To enable the filter by a field we just need to set a proper value to the `elements` property of the field we'd like to filter by.

-   `type`: the type of the field. See "Field types".
-   `enableSorting`: whether the data can be sorted by the given field. True by default.
-   `enableHiding`: whether the field can be hidden. True by default.
-   `enableGlobalSearch`: whether the field is searchable. False by default.
-   `filterBy`: configuration for the filters enabled by the `elements` property.
    -   `operators`: the list of [operators](#operators) supported by the field.
    -   `isPrimary`: whether it is a primary filter. A primary filter is always visible and is not listed in the "Add filter" component, except for the list layout where it behaves like a secondary filter.

### `view`: `object`

The view object configures how the dataset is visible to the user.

Example:

```js
const view = {
	type: 'table',
	search: '',
	filters: [
		{ field: 'author', operator: 'is', value: 2 },
		{ field: 'status', operator: 'isAny', value: [ 'publish', 'draft' ] },
	],
	page: 1,
	perPage: 5,
	sort: {
		field: 'date',
		direction: 'desc',
	},
	fields: [ 'author', 'status' ],
	layout: {},
};
```

Properties:

-   `type`: view type, one of `table`, `grid`, `list`. See "Layout types".
-   `search`: the text search applied to the dataset.
-   `filters`: the filters applied to the dataset. Each item describes:
    -   `field`: which field this filter is bound to.
    -   `operator`: which type of filter it is. See "Operator types".
    -   `value`: the actual value selected by the user.
-   `perPage`: number of records to show per page.
-   `page`: the page that is visible.
-   `sort`:

    -   `field`: the field used for sorting the dataset.
    -   `direction`: the direction to use for sorting, one of `asc` or `desc`.

-   `fields`: the `id` of the fields that are visible in the UI and the specific order in which they are displayed.
-   `layout`: config that is specific to a particular layout type.

#### Properties of `layout`

| Properties of `layout`                                                                                          | Table | Grid | List |
| --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ----- | ---- | ---- |
| `primaryField`: the field's `id` to be highlighted in each layout. It's not hidable.                            | ✓     | ✓    | ✓    |
| `mediaField`: the field's `id` to be used for rendering each card's media. It's not hiddable.                   |       | ✓    | ✓    |
| `columnFields`: a list of field's `id` to render vertically stacked instead of horizontally (the default).      |       | ✓    |      |
| `badgeFields`: a list of field's `id` to render without label and styled as badges.                             |       | ✓    |      |
| `combinedFields`: a list of "virtual" fields that are made by combining others. See "Combining fields" section. | ✓     |      |      |
| `styles`: additional `width`, `maxWidth`, `minWidth` styles for each field column.                              | ✓     |      |      |

### `onChangeView`: `function`

The view is a representation of the visible state of the dataset: what type of layout is used to display it (table, grid, etc.), how the dataset is filtered, how it is sorted or paginated.

It's the consumer's responsibility to work with the data provider to make sure the user options defined through the view's config (sort, pagination, filters, etc.) are respected. The `onChangeView` prop allows the consumer to provide a callback to be called when the view config changes, to process the data accordingly.

The following example shows how a view object is used to query the WordPress REST API via the entities abstraction. The same can be done with any other data provider.

```js
function MyCustomPageTable() {
	const [ view, setView ] = useState( {
		type: 'table',
		perPage: 5,
		page: 1,
		sort: {
			field: 'date',
			direction: 'desc',
		},
		search: '',
		filters: [
			{ field: 'author', operator: 'is', value: 2 },
			{
				field: 'status',
				operator: 'isAny',
				value: [ 'publish', 'draft' ],
			},
		],
		fields: [ 'author', 'status' ],
		layout: {},
	} );

	const queryArgs = useMemo( () => {
		const filters = {};
		view.filters.forEach( ( filter ) => {
			if ( filter.field === 'status' && filter.operator === 'isAny' ) {
				filters.status = filter.value;
			}
			if ( filter.field === 'author' && filter.operator === 'is' ) {
				filters.author = filter.value;
			}
		} );
		return {
			per_page: view.perPage,
			page: view.page,
			_embed: 'author',
			order: view.sort?.direction,
			orderby: view.sort?.field,
			search: view.search,
			...filters,
		};
	}, [ view ] );

	const { records } = useEntityRecords( 'postType', 'page', queryArgs );

	return (
		<DataViews
			data={ records }
			view={ view }
			onChangeView={ setView }
			// ...
		/>
	);
}
```

### `actions`: `Object[]`

Collection of operations that can be performed upon each record.

Each action is an object with the following properties:

-   `id`: string, required. Unique identifier of the action. For example, `move-to-trash`.
-   `label`: string|function, required. User facing description of the action. For example, `Move to Trash`. In case we want to adjust the label based on the selected items, a function which accepts the selected records as input can be provided. This function should always return a `string` value.
-   `isPrimary`: boolean, optional. Whether the action should be listed inline (primary) or in hidden in the more actions menu (secondary).
-   `icon`: icon to show for primary actions. It's required for a primary action, otherwise the action would be considered secondary.
-   `isEligible`: function, optional. Whether the action can be performed for a given record. If not present, the action is considered to be eligible for all items. It takes the given record as input.
-   `isDestructive`: boolean, optional. Whether the action can delete data, in which case the UI would communicate it via red color.
-   `callback`: function, required unless `RenderModal` is provided. Callback function that takes the record as input and performs the required action.
-   `RenderModal`: ReactElement, optional. If an action requires that some UI be rendered in a modal, it can provide a component which takes as props the record as `item` and a `closeModal` function. When this prop is provided, the `callback` property is ignored.
-   `hideModalHeader`: boolean, optional. This property is used in combination with `RenderModal` and controls the visibility of the modal's header. If the action renders a modal and doesn't hide the header, the action's label is going to be used in the modal's header.
-   `supportsBulk`: Whether the action can be used as a bulk action. False by default.
-   `disabled`: Whether the action is disabled. False by default.

### `paginationInfo`: `Object`

-   `totalItems`: the total number of items in the datasets.
-   `totalPages`: the total number of pages, taking into account the total items in the dataset and the number of items per page provided by the user.

### `search`: `boolean`

Whether the search input is enabled. `true` by default.

### `searchLabel`: `string`

What text to show in the search input. "Search" by default.

### `getItemId`: `function`

Function that receives an item and returns an unique identifier for it. By default, it uses the `id` of the item as unique identifier. If it's not, the consumer should provide their own.

### `isLoading`: `boolean`

Whether the data is loading. `false` by default.

### `defaultLayouts`: `Record< string, view >`

This property provides layout information about the view types that are active. If empty, enables all layout types (see "Layout Types") with empty layout data.

For example, this is how you'd enable only the table view type:

```js
const defaultLayouts = {
	table: {
		layout: {
			primaryField: 'my-key',
		},
	},
};
```

The `defaultLayouts` property should be an object that includes properties named `table`, `grid`, or `list`. Each of these properties should contain a `layout` property, which holds the configuration for each specific layout type. Check [here](#properties-of-layout) the full list of properties available for each layout's configuration

### `onChangeSelection`: `function`

Callback that signals the user selected one of more items, and takes them as parameter. So far, only the `list` view implements it.

## Types

### Layouts

-   `table`: the view uses a table layout.
-   `grid`: the view uses a grid layout.
-   `list`: the view uses a list layout.

### Fields

> The `enumeration` type was removed as it was deemed redundant with the field.elements metadata. New types will be introduced soon.

## Combining fields

The `table` layout has the ability to create "virtual" fields that are made out by combining existing ones.

Each "virtual field", has to provide an `id` and `label` (optionally a `header` instead), which have the same meaning as any other field.

Additionally, they need to provide:

-   `children`: a list of field's `id` to combine
-   `direction`: how should they be stacked, `vertical` or `horizontal`

For example, this is how you'd define a `site` field which is a combination of a `title` and `description` fields, which are not displayed:

```js
{
	fields: [ 'site', 'status' ],
	layout: {
		combinedFields: [
			{
				id: 'site',
				label: 'Site',
				children: [ 'title', 'description' ],
				direction: 'vertical',
			}
		]
	}
}
```

### Operators

Allowed operators:

| Operator   | Selection      | Description                                                             | Example                                            |
| ---------- | -------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------- |
| `is`       | Single item    | `EQUAL TO`. The item's field is equal to a single value.                | Author is Admin                                    |
| `isNot`    | Single item    | `NOT EQUAL TO`. The item's field is not equal to a single value.        | Author is not Admin                                |
| `isAny`    | Multiple items | `OR`. The item's field is present in a list of values.                  | Author is any: Admin, Editor                       |
| `isNone`   | Multiple items | `NOT OR`. The item's field is not present in a list of values.          | Author is none: Admin, Editor                      |
| `isAll`    | Multiple items | `AND`. The item's field has all of the values in the list.              | Category is all: Book, Review, Science Fiction     |
| `isNotAll` | Multiple items | `NOT AND`. The item's field doesn't have all of the values in the list. | Category is not all: Book, Review, Science Fiction |

`is` and `isNot` are single-selection operators, while `isAny`, `isNone`, `isAll`, and `isNotALl` are multi-selection. By default, a filter with no operators declared will support the `isAny` and `isNone` multi-selection operators. A filter cannot mix single-selection & multi-selection operators; if a single-selection operator is present in the list of valid operators, the multi-selection ones will be discarded and the filter won't allow selecting more than one item.

> The legacy operators `in` and `notIn` have been deprecated and will be removed soon. In the meantime, they work as `is` and `isNot` operators, respectively.
