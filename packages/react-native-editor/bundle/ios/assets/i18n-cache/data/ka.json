Plugins and themes are able to register their own, opening up all sort of possibilities for rich editing and publishing.":["წარმოიდგინეთ, რომ ყველაფერი, რისი გაკეთებაც შეუძლია WordPress-ს, ხელმისაწვდომია სწრაფად და ერთიანი ადგილიდან. არ არის აუცილებელი HTML-ტეგების გაწერა, ან მალსახმობების რთული სინტაქსის დამახსოვრება, რომლებსაც დაინახავთ რედაქტორის სარკმელში. ღილაკი <code>(+)</code>, რომელსაც დაინახავთ რედაქტორში, საშუალებას მოგცემთ ნახოთ შიგთავსის ხელმისაწვდომი ბლოკები და დაამატოთ ისინი თქვენს სტატიაში. პლაგინებს და თემებს შეუძლიათ დაარეგისტრირონ საკუთარი ბლოკები."],"The <em>Inserter</em> Tool":["<em>ჩასმის</em> ხელსაწყო"],"Try selecting and removing or editing the caption, now you don&#8217;t have to be careful about selecting the image or other text by mistake and ruining the presentation.":["შეეცადეთ აირჩიოთ, წაშალოთ, ან ჩაასწოროთ სათაური. ახლა აღარ მოგიწევთ სიფრთხილე სურათის, ან სხვა ტექსტის არჩევისას, რათა არ დაუშვათ შეცდომა."],"If your theme supports it, you&#8217;ll see the \"wide\" button on the image toolbar.
