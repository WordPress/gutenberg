# Block Card

The `BlockCard` component allows to display a "card" which contains the title of a block, its icon and its description.

In the editor, this component is displayed in two different places: in the block inspector by selecting a block, and as a modal by hovering over a block in the block insertion panel.

## Related components

Block Editor components are components that can be used to compose the UI of your block editor. Thus, they can only be used under a [`BlockEditorProvider`](https://github.com/WordPress/gutenberg/blob/HEAD/packages/block-editor/src/components/provider/README.md) in the components tree.
