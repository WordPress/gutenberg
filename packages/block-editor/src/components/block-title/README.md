# Block Title

The Block Title component renders a block's configured title as a string.

It prioritizes contextual titles such as block variation and reusable block labels when returning a value. If none is found, it will return the display title specified in the block's metadata.

The component will be empty if a title cannot be determined.

## Usage

```jsx
<BlockTitle
	clientId="afd1cb17-2c08-4e7a-91be-007ba7ddc3a1"
	maximumLength={ 12 }
/>
```
