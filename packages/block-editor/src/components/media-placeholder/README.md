# MediaPlaceholder

`MediaPlaceholder` is a React component used to render either the media associated with a block, or an editing interface to replace the media for a block.

## Usage

An example usage which sets the URL of the selected image to `theImage` attributes.

```js
import { MediaPlaceholder } from '@wordpress/block-editor';

...

	edit: ( { attributes, setAttributes } ) => {
		const mediaPlaceholder = <MediaPlaceholder
			onSelect = {
				( el ) => {
					setAttributes( { theImage: el.url } );
				}
			}
			allowedTypes = { [ 'image' ] }
			multiple = { false }
			labels = { { title: 'The Image' } }
		>
			"extra content"
		</MediaPlaceholder>;
		...
	}
```

## Props

### accept

A string passed to `FormFileUpload` that tells the browser which file types can be upload to the upload window the browser use e.g: `image/*,video/*`.
More information about this string is available in https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/input/file#Unique_file_type_specifiers.
This property is similar to the `allowedTypes` property. The difference is the format and the fact that this property affects the behavior of `FormFileUpload` while `allowedTypes` affects the behavior `MediaUpload`.

-   Type: `String`
-   Required: No
-   Platform: Web

### addToGallery

If true, and if `gallery === true` the gallery media modal opens directly in the media library where the user can add additional images. When uploading/selecting files on the placeholder, the placeholder appends the files to the existing files list.
If false the gallery media modal opens in the edit mode where the user can edit existing images, by reordering them, remove them, or change their attributes. When uploading/selecting files on the placeholder the files replace the existing files list.

-   Type: `Boolean`
-   Required: No
-   Default: `false`
-   Platform: Web

### allowedTypes

Array with the types of the media to upload/select from the media library.
Each type is a string that can contain the general mime type e.g: `image`, `audio`, `text`,
or the complete mime type e.g: `audio/mpeg`, `image/gif`.
If allowedTypes is unset all mime types should be allowed.
This property is similar to the `accept` property. The difference is the format and the fact that this property affects the behavior of `MediaUpload` while `accept` affects the behavior `FormFileUpload`.

-   Type: `Array`
-   Required: No
-   Platform: Web | Mobile

### autoOpenMediaUpload

If true, the MediaUpload component auto-opens the picker of the respective platform.

- Type: `Boolean`
- Required: No
- Default: `false`
- Platform: Mobile

### className

Class name added to the placeholder.

-   Type: `String`
-   Required: No
-   Platform: Web

### disableDropZone

If true, the Drop Zone will not be rendered. Users won't be able to drag & drop any media into the component or the block. The UI controls to upload the media via file, url or the media library would be intact.

-   Type: `Boolean`
-   Required: No
-   Default: `false`

### dropZoneUIOnly

If true, only the Drop Zone will be rendered. No UI controls to upload the media will be shown.
The `disableDropZone` prop still takes precedence over `dropZoneUIOnly` â€“ specifying both as true will result in nothing to be rendered.

-   Type: `Boolean`
-   Required: No
-   Default: `false`

### icon

Icon to display left of the title. When passed as a `String`, the icon will be resolved as a [Dashicon](https://developer.wordpress.org/resource/dashicons/). Alternatively, you can pass in a `Component` such as `BlockIcon`to render instead.

-   Type: `String|Component`
-   Required: No
-   Platform: Web | Mobile

### isAppender

If true, the property changes the look of the placeholder to be adequate to scenarios where new files are added to an already existing set of files, e.g., adding files to a gallery.
If false the default placeholder style is used.

-   Type: `Boolean`
-   Required: No
-   Default: `false`
-   Platform: Web | Mobile

### disableMediaButtons

If true, only the Drop Zone will be rendered. No UI controls to upload the media will be shown

-   Type: `Boolean`
-   Required: No
-   Default: `false`
-   Platform: Web | Mobile

### labels

An object that can contain a `title` and `instructions` properties. These properties are passed to the placeholder component as `label` and `instructions` respectively.

-   Type: `Object`
-   Required: No
-   Platform: Web | Mobile

### multiple

Whether to allow multiple selection of files or not. This property will also accept a string with the value `add` to allow multiple selection of files without the need to use the `Shift` or `Ctrl`/`Cmd` keys.

-   Type: `Boolean|String`
-   Required: No
-   Default: `false`
-   Platform: Web

## Extend

It includes a `wp.hooks` filter `editor.MediaPlaceholder` that enables developers to replace or extend it.

_Example:_

Replace implementation of the placeholder:

```js
function replaceMediaPlaceholder() {
	return function () {
		return React.createElement(
			'div',
			{},
			'The replacement contents or components.'
		);
	};
}

wp.hooks.addFilter(
	'editor.MediaPlaceholder',
	'my-plugin/replace-media-placeholder',
	replaceMediaPlaceholder
);
```
