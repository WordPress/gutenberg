# ESLint Plugin

[ESLint](https://eslint.org/) plugin including configurations and custom rules for WordPress development.

## Installation

Install the module

```bash
npm install @wordpress/eslint-plugin --save-dev
```

**Note**: This package requires Node.js version with long-term support status (check [Active LTS or Maintenance LTS releases](https://nodejs.org/en/about/previous-releases)). It is not compatible with older versions.

## Usage

To opt-in to the default configuration, extend your own project's `.eslintrc` file:

```json
{
	"extends": [ "plugin:@wordpress/eslint-plugin/recommended" ]
}
```

Refer to the [ESLint documentation on Shareable Configs](http://eslint.org/docs/developer-guide/shareable-configs) for more information.

The `recommended` preset will include rules governing an ES2015+ environment, and includes rules from the [`eslint-plugin-jsdoc`](https://github.com/gajus/eslint-plugin-jsdoc), [`eslint-plugin-jsx-a11y`](https://github.com/jsx-eslint/eslint-plugin-jsx-a11y), [`eslint-plugin-react`](https://github.com/yannickcr/eslint-plugin-react), and other similar plugins.

This preset offers an optional integration with the [`eslint-plugin-prettier`](https://github.com/prettier/eslint-plugin-prettier) package that runs [Prettier](https://prettier.io) code formatter and reports differences as individual ESLint issues. You can activate it by installing the [`prettier`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/prettier) package separately with:

```bash
npm install prettier --save-dev
```

Finally, this ruleset also includes an optional integration with the [`@typescript-eslint/eslint-plugin`](https://github.com/typescript-eslint/typescript-eslint) package that enables ESLint to support [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org) language. You can activate it by installing the [`typescript`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/typescript) package separately with:

```bash
npm install typescript --save-dev
```

There is also `recommended-with-formatting` ruleset for projects that want to ensure that [Prettier](https://prettier.io) and [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org) integration is never activated. This preset has the native ESLint code formatting rules enabled instead.

### Rulesets

Alternatively, you can opt-in to only the more granular rulesets offered by the plugin. These include:

-   `custom` – custom rules for WordPress development.
-   `es5` – rules for legacy ES5 environments.
-   `esnext` – rules for ES2015+ environments.
-   `i18n` – rules for internationalization.
-   `jsdoc` – rules for JSDoc comments.
-   `jsx-a11y` – rules for accessibility in JSX.
-   `react` – rules for React components.
-   `test-e2e` – rules for end-to-end tests written in Puppeteer.
-   `test-unit`– rules for unit tests written in Jest.
-   `test-playwright` – rules for end-to-end tests written in Playwright.

For example, if your project does not use React, you could consider extending including only the ESNext rules in your project using the following `extends` definition:

```json
{
	"extends": [ "plugin:@wordpress/eslint-plugin/esnext" ]
}
```

These rules can be used additively, so you could extend both `esnext` and `custom` rulesets, but omit the `react` and `jsx-a11y` configurations.

The granular rulesets will not define any environment globals. As such, if they are required for your project, you will need to define them yourself.

### Legacy

If you are using WordPress' `.jshintrc` JSHint configuration and you would like to take the first step to migrate to an ESLint equivalent it is also possible to define your own project's `.eslintrc` file as:

```json
{
	"extends": [ "plugin:@wordpress/eslint-plugin/jshint" ]
}
```
