# Viewport

Viewport is a module for responding to changes in the browser viewport size. It registers its own [data module](https://github.com/WordPress/gutenberg/tree/master/packages/data), updated in response to browser media queries on a standard set of supported breakpoints. This data and the included higher-order components can be used in your own modules and components to implement viewport-dependent behaviors.

## Installation

Install the module

```bash
npm install @wordpress/viewport --save
```

_This package assumes that your code will run in an ES5 environment. If you're using an environment that has limited or no support for ES5 such as lower versions of IE then using [@babel/polyfill](https://babeljs.io/docs/en/next/babel-polyfill) will add support for these methods. Learn more about it in [Babel docs](https://babeljs.io/docs/en/next/caveats)._

## Breakpoints

The standard set of breakpoint thresholds is as follows:

Name|Pixel Width
---|---
`huge`|1440
`wide`|1280
`large`|960
`medium`|782
`small`|600
`mobile`|480

## Data Module

The Viewport module registers itself under the `core/viewport` data namespace.

```js
const isSmall = select( 'core/viewport' ).isViewportMatch( '< medium' );
```

The `isViewportMatch` selector accepts a single string argument `query`. It consists of an optional operator and breakpoint name, separated with a space. The operator can be `<` or `>=`, defaulting to `>=`.

```js
const { isViewportMatch } = select( 'core/viewport' );
const isSmall = isViewportMatch( '< medium' );
const isWideOrHuge = isViewportMatch( '>= wide' );
// Equivalent: 
//  const isWideOrHuge = isViewportMatch( 'wide' );
```

## `ifViewportMatches` Higher-Order Component

If you are authoring a component which should only be shown under a specific viewport condition, you can leverage the `ifViewportMatches` higher-order component to achieve this requirement.

Pass a viewport query to render the component only when the query is matched:

```jsx
function MyMobileComponent() {
	return <div>I'm only rendered on mobile viewports!</div>;
}

MyMobileComponent = ifViewportMatches( '< small' )( MyMobileComponent );
```

## `withViewportMatch` Higher-Order Component

If you are authoring a component which should vary its rendering behavior depending upon the matching viewport, you can leverage the `withViewportMatch` higher-order component to achieve this requirement.

Pass an object, where each key is a prop name and its value a viewport query. The component will be rendered with your prop(s) assigned with the result(s) of the query match:

```jsx
function MyComponent( { isMobile } ) {
	return (
		<div>Currently: { isMobile ? 'Mobile' : 'Not Mobile' }</div>
	);
}

MyComponent = withViewportMatch( { isMobile: '< small' } )( MyComponent );
```
