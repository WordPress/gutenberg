# Create Block

Create Block is an **officially supported tool for scaffolding a WordPress plugin that registers a block**. It generates PHP, JS, CSS code, and everything you need to start the project. It also integrates a modern build setup with no configuration.

_It is largely inspired by [create-react-app](https://create-react-app.dev/docs/getting-started). Major kudos to [@gaearon](https://github.com/gaearon), the whole Facebook team, and the React community._

> **Blocks are the fundamental elements of modern WordPress sites**. Introduced in [WordPress 5.0](https://wordpress.org/news/2018/12/bebo/), they allow [page and post builder-like functionality](https://wordpress.org/gutenberg/) to every up-to-date WordPress website.

## Quick start

```bash
$ npx @wordpress/create-block@latest todo-list
$ cd todo-list
$ npm start
```

The `slug` provided (`todo-list` in the example) defines the folder name for the scaffolded plugin and the internal block name. The WordPress plugin generated must [be installed manually](https://wordpress.org/documentation/article/manage-plugins/#manual-plugin-installation-1).


_(requires `node` version `20.10.0` or above, and `npm` version `10.2.3` or above)_

## Usage

The `create-block` command generates a project with PHP, JS, and CSS code for registering a block with a WordPress plugin.

```bash
$ npx @wordpress/create-block@latest [options] [slug]
```

> The name for a block is a unique string that identifies a block. Block Names are structured as `namespace`/`slug`, where namespace is the name of your plugin or theme.

> In most cases, we recommended pairing blocks with WordPress plugins rather than themes, because only using plugin ensures that all blocks still work when your theme changes.

### Interactive Mode

When no `slug` is provided, the script will run in interactive mode and will start prompting for the input required (`slug`, title, namespace...) to scaffold the project.


### `slug`

The use of `slug` is optional.

When provided it triggers the _quick mode_, where this `slug` is used:
- as the block slug (required for its identification)
- as the output location (folder name) for scaffolded files
- as the name of the WordPress plugin.

The rest of the configuration is set to all default values unless overridden with some options listed below.

### `options`


```bash
-V, --version                output the version number
-t, --template <name>        project template type name; allowed values: "static" (default), "es5", the name of an external npm package, or the path to a local directory
--no-plugin                  scaffold block files only
--namespace <value>          internal namespace for the block name
--title <value>              display title for the block and the WordPress plugin
--short-description <value>  short description for the block and the WordPress plugin
--category <name>            category name for the block
--wp-scripts                 enable integration with `@wordpress/scripts` package
--no-wp-scripts              disable integration with `@wordpress/scripts` package
--wp-env                     enable integration with `@wordpress/env` package
-h, --help                   output usage information
--variant                    choose a block variant as defined by the template
```

#### `--template`

This argument specifies an _external npm package_ as a template.

```bash
$ npx @wordpress/create-block@latest --template my-template-package
```

This argument also allows to pick a _local directory_ as a template.

```bash
$ npx @wordpress/create-block@latest --template ./path/to/template-directory
```

#### `--variant`

With this argument, `create-block` will generate a [dynamic block](https://developer.wordpress.org/block-editor/getting-started/glossary/#dynamic-block) based on the built-in template.

```bash
$ npx @wordpress/create-block@latest --variant dynamic
```

#### `--help`

With this argument, the `create-block` package outputs usage information.

```bash
$ npx @wordpress/create-block@latest --help
```

#### `--no-plugin`

With this argument, the `create-block` package runs in _No plugin mode_ which only scaffolds block files into the current directory.

```bash
$ npx @wordpress/create-block@latest --no-plugin
```
#### `--wp-env`

With this argument, the `create-block` package will add to the generated plugin the configuration and the script to run [`wp-env` package](https://developer.wordpress.org/block-editor/reference-guides/packages/packages-env/) within the plugin. This will allow you to easily set up a local WordPress environment (via Docker) for building and testing the generated plugin.

```bash
$ npx @wordpress/create-block@latest --wp-env
```

## Available commands in the scaffolded project

The plugin folder created when executing this command, is a node package with a modern build setup that requires no configuration.

A set of scripts is available from inside that folder (provided by the `scripts` package) to make your work easier. [Click here](https://github.com/WordPress/gutenberg/tree/HEAD/packages/scripts#available-scripts) for a full description of these commands.

_Note: You donâ€™t need to install or configure tools like [webpack](https://webpack.js.org), [Babel](https://babeljs.io) or [ESLint](https://eslint.org) yourself. They are preconfigured and hidden so that you can focus on coding._

For example, running the `start` script from inside the generated folder (`npm start`) would automatically start the build for development.
