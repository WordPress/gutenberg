# Style Engine

The Style Engine powering global styles and block customizations.

## Installation

Install the module

```bash
npm install @wordpress/style-engine --save
```

_This package assumes that your code will run in an **ES2015+** environment. If you're using an environment that has limited or no support for such language features and APIs, you should include [the polyfill shipped in `@wordpress/babel-preset-default`](https://github.com/WordPress/gutenberg/tree/HEAD/packages/babel-preset-default#polyfill) in your code._

## Important

This Package is considered experimental at the moment. The idea is to have a package used to generate styles based on a style object that is consistent between: backend, frontend, block style object and theme.json.

Currently it's not a package that generates a wp.styleEngine global because it's not ready yet, it's still a bundled package but ultimately, we want it to be so, once the roadmap is finished:

**TODO List:**

-   Add style definitions for all the currently supported styles in blocks and theme.json.
-   the CSS variable shortcuts for values (for presets...)
-   Support generating styles in the frontend.
-   Support generating styles in the backend (block supports and theme.json stylesheet).
-   Refactor all block styles to use the style engine server side.
-   Refactor all blocks to consistently use the "style" attribute for all customizations (get rid of the preset specific attributes).
