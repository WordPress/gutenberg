## Keeping up with the WordPress project

Once you have finished reviewing this chapter, you will have a solid understanding of blocks and how to develop for the Block Editor, but what's next? 

The WordPress project, and Gutenberg in particular, iterates quickly. Staying up-to-date on all the changes can be challenging. So, here are a few essential developer resources you should be aware of. Each person will have their own unique needs in keeping up with a project of this scale, so choose what's right for you.

- **[WordPress Roadmap](https://wordpress.org/about/roadmap/):** The high-level roadmap for WordPress and Gutenberg.
- **[Make Core](https://make.wordpress.org/core/):** The primary blog for WordPress Core where all major project updates are posted.
- **[WordPress Slack](https://make.wordpress.org/chat/):** The official Slack community for all WordPress contributors is the hub for team meetings, ongoing conversations, and more. Make sure to join the `#core` and `#core-editor` channels.
- **[Gutenberg GitHub repository](https://github.com/WordPress/gutenberg/):** This is where all Block Editor development happens. Keeping a close eye on the repository will give you a real-time understanding of whatâ€™s being worked on by fellow contributors.
- **[Keeping up with Gutenberg](https://make.wordpress.org/core/handbook/references/keeping-up-with-gutenberg-index/):** A compilation of Gutenberg-related posts from the many [Make teams](https://make.wordpress.org/), including Core, Design, Meta, and Themes.
- **["What's new in Gutenberg?"](https://make.wordpress.org/core/tag/gutenberg-new/):** Biweekly posts published on Make Core with each Gutenberg release. They are a great way to review the most relevant new features and the full changelog.
- **["What's new for developers?"](https://developer.wordpress.org/news/):** Monthly posts on the WordPress Developer Blog that showcase the most important developer-related changes that happened in WordPress the previous month.
