# Use styles and stylesheets

## Overview

A block typically inserts markup (HTML) into post content that you want to style in some way. This guide walks through a few different ways you can use CSS with the block editor and how to work with styles and stylesheets.

## Before you start

You will need a basic block and WordPress development environment to implement the examples shown in this guide. See the [Quick Start Guide](/docs/getting-started/quick-start-guide.md) or [block tutorial](/docs/getting-started/tutorial.md) to get set up.

## Methods to add style

The following are different methods you can use to add style to your block, either in the editor or when saved.

## Method 1: Inline style

The first method shows adding the style inline. This transforms the defined style into a property on the element inserted.

The `useBlockProps` React hook is used to set and apply properties on the block's wrapper element. The following example shows how:

```jsx
import { registerBlockType } from '@wordpress/blocks';
import { useBlockProps } from '@wordpress/block-editor';

registerBlockType( 'gutenberg-examples/example-02-stylesheets', {
	edit() {
		const greenBackground = {
			backgroundColor: '#090',
			color: '#fff',
			padding: '20px',
		};

		const blockProps = useBlockProps( { style: greenBackground } );

		return (
			<p { ...blockProps }>Hello World (from the editor, in green).</p>
		);
	},
	save() {
		const redBackground = {
			backgroundColor: '#900',
			color: '#fff',
			padding: '20px',
		};

		const blockProps = useBlockProps.save( { style: redBackground } );

		return (
			<p { ...blockProps }>Hello World (from the frontend, in red).</p>
		);
	},
} );
```

## Method 2: Block classname

The inline style works well for a small amount of CSS to apply. If you have much more than the above you will likely find that it is easier to manage with them in a separate stylesheet file.

The `useBlockProps` hooks includes the classname for the block automatically, it generates a name for each block using the block's name prefixed with `wp-block-`, replacing the `/` namespace separator with a single `-`.

For example the block name: `gutenberg-examples/example-02-stylesheets` would get the classname: `wp-block-gutenberg-examples-example-02-stylesheets`. It might be a bit long but best to avoid conflicts with other blocks.

```jsx
import { registerBlockType } from '@wordpress/blocks';
import { useBlockProps } from '@wordpress/block-editor';

registerBlockType( 'gutenberg-examples/example-02-stylesheets', {
	edit() {
		const blockProps = useBlockProps();

		return (
			<p { ...blockProps }>Hello World (from the editor, in green).</p>
		);
	},
	save() {
		const blockProps = useBlockProps.save();

		return (
			<p { ...blockProps }>Hello World (from the frontend, in red).</p>
		);
	},
} );
```

### Build or add dependency

In order to include the blockEditor as a dependency, make sure to run the build step, or update the asset php file.

Build the scripts and update the asset file which is used to keep track of dependencies and the build version.
```bash
npm run build
```

### Enqueue stylesheets

Like scripts, you can enqueue your block's styles using the `block.json` file.

Use the `editorStyle` property to a CSS file you want to load in the editor view only, use the `style` property for a CSS file you want to load both in the editor view and on the frontend when the block is used, and use the `viewStyle` property for a CSS file you want to load only on the frontend when the block is used.

It is worth noting that, if the editor content is iframed, both the `style` and `editorStyle` will load in the iframe. `editorStyle` will also load outside the iframe, so it can be used for editor content as well as UI.

For example:

```json
{
	"apiVersion": 3,
	"name": "gutenberg-examples/example-02-stylesheets",
	"title": "Example: Stylesheets",
	"icon": "universal-access-alt",
	"category": "layout",
	"editorScript": "file:./block.js",
	"editorStyle": "file:./editor.css",
	"style": "file:./style.css"
}
```

So in your plugin directory, create an `editor.css` file to load in editor view:

```css
/* green background */
.wp-block-gutenberg-examples-example-02-stylesheets {
	background: #090;
	color: white;
	padding: 20px;
}
```

And a `style.css` file to load on the frontend:

```css
/* red background */
.wp-block-gutenberg-examples-example-02-stylesheets {
	background: #900;
	color: white;
	padding: 20px;
}
```

The files will automatically be enqueued when specified in the block.json.

<div class="callout callout-info">

If you are using `@wordpress/scripts` you will need to import your stylesheet within your corresponding JavaScript file in order for `@wordpress/scripts` to process the stylesheet.

Example:

- In `edit.js` you would place `import './editor.scss';`
- In `index.js` you would place `import './style.scss';`
- In `view.js` you would place `import './view.scss';` (interactive block template)
</div>

**Note:** If you have multiple files to include, you can use standard `wp_enqueue_style` functions like any other plugin or theme. You will want to use the following hooks for the block editor:

-   `enqueue_block_editor_assets` - to load only in editor view
-   `enqueue_block_assets` - loads both on frontend and editor view

## Conclusion

This guide showed a couple of different ways to apply styles to your block, by either inline or in its own style sheet. Both of these methods use the `useBlockProps` hook, see the [block wrapper reference documentation](/docs/reference-guides/block-api/block-edit-save.md#block-wrapper-props) for additional details.
