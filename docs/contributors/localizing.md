# Localizing Gutenberg

The Gutenberg plugin is translated via the general plugin translation system (GlotPress) at https://translate.wordpress.org. Review the [GlotPress translation process documentation](https://make.wordpress.org/polyglots/handbook/tools/glotpress-translate-wordpress-org/) for additional information.

To translate Gutenberg in your locale or language, [select your locale here](https://translate.wordpress.org/projects/wp-plugins/gutenberg) and translate _Development_ (which contains the plugin's string) and/or _Development Readme_ (please translate what you see in the Details tab of the [plugin page](https://wordpress.org/plugins/gutenberg/)).

A Global Translation Editor (GTE) or Project Translation Editor (PTE) with suitable rights will process your translations in due time.

Language packs are automatically generated once 95% of the plugin's strings are translated and approved for a locale.

The inclusion of Gutenberg into WordPress core means that more than 51% of WordPress installations running a translated WordPress installation have Gutenberg's translated strings compiled into the core language pack as well.
