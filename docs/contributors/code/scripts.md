# Scripts

The editor provides several vendor and internal scripts to plugin developers. Script names, handles, and descriptions are documented in the table below.

## WordPress scripts

The editor includes a number of packages to enable various pieces of functionality. Plugin developers can utilize them to create blocks, editor plugins, or generic plugins.

## Vendor scripts

The editor also uses some popular third-party packages and scripts. Plugin developers can use these scripts as well without bundling them in their code (and increasing file sizes).

| Script Name                                          | Handle    | Description                                                                                           |

## Polyfill scripts

The editor also provides polyfills for certain features that may not be available in all modern browsers.

It is recommended to use the main `wp-polyfill` script handle which takes care of loading all the below mentioned polyfills.

| Script Name                                                               | Handle                      | Description                                                                                          |

## Bundling and code sharing

When using a JavaScript bundler like [webpack](https://webpack.js.org/), the scripts mentioned here can be excluded from the bundle and provided by WordPress in the form of script dependencies see [`wp_enqueue_script`](https://developer.wordpress.org/reference/functions/wp_enqueue_script/#default-scripts-included-and-registered-by-wordpress).

The [`@wordpress/dependency-extraction-webpack-plugin`](https://github.com/WordPress/gutenberg/tree/HEAD/packages/dependency-extraction-webpack-plugin) provides a webpack plugin to help extract WordPress dependencies from bundles. The `@wordpress/scripts` [`build`](https://github.com/WordPress/gutenberg/tree/HEAD/packages/scripts#build) script includes the plugin by default.
