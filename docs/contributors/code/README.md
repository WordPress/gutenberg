# Code Contributions

A guide on how to get started contributing code to the Gutenberg project.

## Discussions

The [Make WordPress Core blog](https://make.wordpress.org/core/) is the primary spot for the latest information around WordPress development: including announcements, product goals, meeting notes, meeting agendas, and more.

Real-time discussions for development take place in `#core-editor` and `#core-js` channels in [Make WordPress Slack](https://make.wordpress.org/chat) (registration required). Weekly meetings for the editor component are on Wednesdays at 14:00UTC, and for the JavaScript component on Tuesday at 15:00UTC, in their respective Slack channels.

## Development Hub

The Gutenberg project uses GitHub for managing code and tracking issues. The main repository is at: [https://github.com/WordPress/gutenberg](https://github.com/WordPress/gutenberg).

Browse [the issues list](https://github.com/wordpress/gutenberg/issues) to find issues to work on. The [good first issue](https://github.com/wordpress/gutenberg/issues?q=is%3Aopen+is%3Aissue+label%3A%22Good+First+Issue%22) and [good first review](https://github.com/WordPress/gutenberg/pulls?q=is%3Aopen+is%3Apr+label%3A%22Good+First+Review%22) labels are good starting points.
