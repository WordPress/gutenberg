## Editor

-   [Key concepts](/docs/explanations/architecture/key-concepts.md).
-   [Data format and data flow](/docs/explanations/architecture/data-flow.md).
-   [Entities and undo/redo](/docs/explanations/architecture/entities.md).
-   [Site editing templates](/docs/explanations/architecture/full-site-editing-templates.md).
-   [Styles in the editor](/docs/explanations/architecture/styles.md).
-   [Performance](/docs/explanations/architecture/performance.md).

## Gutenberg repository

-   [Modularity and WordPress Packages](/docs/explanations/architecture/modularity.md).
-   [Understand the repository folder structure](/docs/contributors/folder-structure.md).
-   **Outdated!** [Why is Puppeteer the tool of choice for end-to-end tests?](/docs/explanations/architecture/automated-testing.md).
