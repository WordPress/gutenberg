# How to Contribute

First off, thank you for contributing! We're excited to collaborate with you! 🎉

The following is a set of guidelines for the many ways you can join our collective effort.

Before anything else, please take a moment to read our [Code of Conduct](CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md). We expect all participants, from full-timers to occasional tinkerers, to uphold it.

## Reporting Bugs, Asking Questions, and Suggesting Features

Have a suggestion or feedback? Please go to [Issues](https://github.com/wordpress-mobile/gutenberg-mobile/issues) and [open a new issue](https://github.com/wordpress-mobile/gutenberg-mobile/issues/new). Add at least on type label to it _"[Type] Bug"_, _"[Type] Question:"_, or _"[Type] Feature Request:"_. Screenshots help us resolve issues and answer questions faster, so thanks for including some if you can.

## Submitting Code Changes

If you're just getting started and want to familiarize yourself with the app’s code, we suggest looking at [these issues](https://github.com/wordpress-mobile/gutenberg-mobile/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen+label%3A%22good+first+issue%22) with the **good first issue** label. But if you’d like to tackle something different, you're more than welcome to visit the [Issues](https://github.com/wordpress-mobile/gutenberg-mobile/issues) page and pick an item that interests you.

We always try to avoid duplicating efforts, so if you decide to work on an issue, leave a comment to state your intent. If you choose to focus on a new feature or the change you’re proposing is significant, we recommend waiting for a response before proceeding. The issue may no longer align with project goals.

If the change is trivial, feel free to send a pull request without notifying us.

### Pull Requests and Code Reviews

All code contributions pass through pull requests. If you haven't created a pull request before, we recommend this free video series, [How to Contribute to an Open Source Project on GitHub](https://egghead.io/courses/how-to-contribute-to-an-open-source-project-on-github).

The core team monitors and reviews all pull requests. Depending on the changes, we will either approve them or close them with an explanation. We might also work with you to improve a pull request before approval.

We do our best to respond quickly to all pull requests. If you don't get a response from us after a week, feel free to reach out to us via Slack.

## Getting in Touch

If you have questions or just want to say hi, join the [WordPress Slack](https://make.wordpress.org/chat/) and drop a message on the `#mobile` channel.
