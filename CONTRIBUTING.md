# Contributing

Thank you for thinking about contributing to WordPress' Gutenberg project! If you're unsure of anything, know that you're ðŸ’¯ welcome to submit an issue or pull request on any topic. The worst that can happen is that you'll be politely directed to the best location to ask your question or to change something in your pull request. We appreciate any sort of contribution and don't want a wall of rules to get in the way of that.

As with all WordPress projects, we want to ensure a welcoming environment for everyone. With that in mind, all contributors are expected to follow our [Code of Conduct](/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md).

Before contributing, we encourage you to review the [Contributor Handbook](https://developer.wordpress.org/block-editor/contributors/). If you have any questions, please ask, either in Slack or open an issue in GitHub so we can help clarify.

All WordPress projects are [licensed under the GPLv2+](/LICENSE.md), and all contributions to Gutenberg will be released under the GPLv2+ license. You maintain copyright over any contribution you make, and by submitting a pull request, you are agreeing to release that contribution under the GPLv2+ license.

This document covers the technical details around setup, and submitting your contribution to the Gutenberg project.

## Developer Contributions

Please see the [Developer Contributions section](/docs/contributors/develop.md) of the Contributor Handbook.

## How Can Designers Contribute?

If you'd like to contribute to the design or front-end, feel free to contribute to tickets labelled [Needs Design](https://github.com/WordPress/gutenberg/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen+label%3A%22Needs+Design%22) or [Needs Design Feedback](https://github.com/WordPress/gutenberg/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen+label%3A"Needs+Design+Feedback%22). We could use your thoughtful replies, mockups, animatics, sketches, doodles. Proposed changes are best done as minimal and specific iterations on the work that precedes it so we can compare. The [WordPress Design team](http://make.wordpress.org/design/) uses [Figma](https://www.figma.com/) to collaborate and share work. If you'd like to contribute, join the [#design channel](http://wordpress.slack.com/messages/design/) in [Slack](https://make.wordpress.org/chat/) and ask the team to set you up with a free Figma account. This will give you access to a helpful [library of components](https://www.figma.com/file/ZtN5xslEVYgzU7Dd5CxgGZwq/WordPress-Components?node-id=0%3A1) used in WordPress.
