# Contributing Guidelines

Welcome to WordPress' Gutenberg project! We hope you join us in creating the future platform for publishing; all are welcome here.

## How can I contribute?

To learn all about contributing to the Gutenberg project, see the [Contributor Guide](/docs/contributors/README.md). The handbook includes all the details you need to get setup and start shaping the future of web publishing.

-   Code? See the [developer section](/docs/contributors/code/README.md).

-   Design? See the [design section](/docs/contributors/design/README.md).

-   Documentation? See the [documentation section](/docs/contributors/documentation/README.md).

-   Triage? We need help reviewing existing issues to make sure theyâ€™re relevant and actionable. Triage is an important contribution because it allows us to work on the highest priority issues. To learn more, please see the [triaging issues section](docs/contributors/triage.md).

## Guidelines

-   As with all WordPress projects, we want to ensure a welcoming environment for everyone. With that in mind, all contributors are expected to follow our [Code of Conduct](https://make.wordpress.org/handbook/community-code-of-conduct/).

-   Contributors should review the [overall process and best practices for pull requests](https://github.com/WordPress/gutenberg/blob/trunk/docs/contributors/repository-management.md#pull-requests), adhering to WordPress' [JavaScript coding standards](https://developer.wordpress.org/coding-standards/wordpress-coding-standards/javascript/) and [accessibility coding standards](https://developer.wordpress.org/coding-standards/wordpress-coding-standards/accessibility/).

-   Accessibility should be top of mind and thoroughly tested by following the [accessibility testing instructions](https://github.com/WordPress/gutenberg/blob/HEAD/docs/contributors/accessibility-testing.md).

-   Verify that any changes in your PR that affect function/class/variable names are mirrored in the corresponding `.native.js` versions of the files to avoid introducing breaking changes in the [React Native Mobile Editor](https://github.com/WordPress/gutenberg/tree/trunk/docs/contributors/code/react-native).

-   You maintain copyright over any contribution you make. By submitting a pull request you agree to release that code under [Gutenberg's License](/LICENSE.md).
