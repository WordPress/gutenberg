 * This class is designed for internal use by the HTML processor.
 *
 * The HTML API aims to operate in compliance with the HTML5
 * specification, but does not implement the full specification.
 * In cases where it lacks support it should not cause breakage
 * or unexpected behavior. In the cases where it recognizes that
 * it cannot proceed, this class is used to abort from any
 * operation and signify that the given HTML cannot be processed.

 * @since 6.4.0
 * @since 6.7.0 Gained contextual information for use in debugging parse failures.
