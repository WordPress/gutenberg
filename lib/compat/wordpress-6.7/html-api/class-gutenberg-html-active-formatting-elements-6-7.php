 *
 * > Initially, the list of active formatting elements is empty.
 * > It is used to handle mis-nested formatting element tags.
 * >
 * > The list contains elements in the formatting category, and markers.
 * > The markers are inserted when entering applet, object, marquee,
 * > template, td, th, and caption elements, and are used to prevent
 * > formatting from "leaking" into applet, object, marquee, template,
 * > td, th, and caption elements.
 * >
 * > In addition, each element in the list of active formatting elements
 * > is associated with the token for which it was created, so that
 * > further elements can be created for that token if necessary.
