/**
 * Inline (partial-text) note support for block comments.
 *
 * Block comments (notes) shipped in WordPress 6.9; see
 * `lib/compat/wordpress-6.9/block-comments.php`. Inline notes - notes anchored
 * to a text selection within a block rather than the whole block - are a 7.1
 * addition and live here.
 *
 * An inline note's anchor is the in-content `<mark class="wp-note" data-id="N">`
 * marker alone: the `data-id` identifies the note and the marker's position
 * follows edits, so no separate selection metadata is stored. The marker is
 * kept in the raw `post_content` (and REST `raw` view) and only stripped from
 * rendered front-end output by the filter below.

/**
 * Strip inline note markers from rendered block output.
 *
 * Inline notes are anchored in raw block content with
 * `<mark class="wp-note" data-id="N">…</mark>` so the marker survives edits,
 * but the public HTML should not expose note metadata. `render_block` unwraps
 * the marker entirely - dropping the `<mark>` open tag and its matching closer
 * while keeping the marked text - so nothing leaks to the front end. The raw
 * `post_content` (and the REST `raw` view, revisions, exports) keeps the marker
 * so the editor can re-attach on reload.
 *
 * Only note markers are unwrapped: `WP_HTML_Tag_Processor::has_class()` matches
 * the `wp-note` class by exact token, so a `<mark>` a user or plugin added
 * (e.g. a `core/text-color` highlight, or an unrelated `wp-note-foo` class) is
 * never flagged and survives byte-for-byte with all of its attributes intact.
 * A naive regex would be wrong here: a `\bwp-note\b` word boundary also matches
 * `wp-note-foo`, which is why the class check goes through the HTML API instead.
 *
 * The HTML API has no public token-removal method yet (it is on the roadmap:
 * https://github.com/WordPress/gutenberg/discussions/54583), so an anonymous
 * `WP_HTML_Tag_Processor` subclass unwraps each note `<mark>` and its matching
 * closer directly on the parsed token stream. Walking tokens - rather than
 * matching `<mark>` with a regex - means `</mark>`-looking text inside a comment
 * or attribute value can never be mistaken for a real tag, and a nesting stack
 * keeps each note opener paired with its own closer so overlapping notes and any
 * user highlight `<mark>` left intact still resolve correctly.
 *
 * @param string $block_content Rendered block HTML.
 * @return string Block HTML with wp-note markers unwrapped.
