# Gutenberg

Prototyping since 1440.

This is the development and prototyping hub for the editor focus in core.

> The editor will endeavour to create a new page and post building experience that makes writing rich posts effortless, and has “blocks” to make it easy what today might take shortcodes, custom HTML, or “mystery meat” embed discovery. — Matt Mullenweg
