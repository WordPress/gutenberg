The Gutenberg plugin adds editing, customization, and site building to WordPress. Use it to test beta features before their official release.

== Description ==

“Gutenberg” is a codename for a whole new paradigm for creating with WordPress, that aims to revolutionize the entire publishing experience as much as <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Johannes_Gutenberg">Johannes Gutenberg</a> did the printed word. The project is <a href="https://wordpress.org/about/roadmap/">following a four-phase process</a> that will touch major pieces of WordPress — Editing, Customization, Collaboration, and Multilingual.

Following the introduction of post block editing in December 2018, Gutenberg later introduced full site editing (FSE) in 2021, <a href="https://wordpress.org/news/2022/01/josephine/">which shipped with WordPress 5.9 in early 2022</a>.

### What Does Gutenberg Do?

Gutenberg is WordPress's “block editor”, and introduces a modular approach to modifying your entire site. Edit individual content blocks on posts or pages. Add and adjust widgets. Even design your site headers, footers, and navigation with full site editing support.

Each piece of content in the editor, from a paragraph to an image gallery to a headline, is its own block. And just like physical blocks, WordPress blocks can be added, arranged, and rearranged, allowing users to create media-rich content and site layouts in a visually intuitive way — and without workarounds like shortcodes or custom HTML and PHP.

We’re always hard at work refining the experience, creating more and better blocks, and laying the groundwork for future phases of work. Each WordPress release includes stable features from the Gutenberg plugin, so you don’t need to install the plugin to benefit from the work being done here.

### Early Access

Are you a tech-savvy early adopter who likes testing bleeding-edge and experimental features, and isn’t afraid to tinker with features that are still in active development? If so, this beta plugin gives you access to the latest Gutenberg features for block and full site editing, as well as a peek into what’s to come.

### Contributors Wanted

For the adventurous and tech-savvy, the Gutenberg plugin gives you the latest and greatest feature set, so you can join us in testing and developing bleeding-edge features, playing around with blocks, and maybe <a href="https://developer.wordpress.org/block-editor/contributors/">get inspired to contribute</a> or <a href="https://developer.wordpress.org/block-editor/how-to-guides/block-tutorial/">build your own blocks</a>.

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= How can I send feedback or get help with a bug? =

The best place to report bugs, feature suggestions, or any other feedback is at <a href="https://github.com/WordPress/gutenberg/issues">the Gutenberg GitHub issues page</a>. Before submitting a new issue, please search the existing issues to check if someone else has reported the same feedback.

While we try to triage issues reported here on the plugin forum, you’ll get a faster response (and reduce duplication of effort) by keeping feedback centralized in GitHub.

= Where can I report security bugs? =

The Gutenberg team and WordPress community take security bugs seriously. We appreciate your efforts to responsibly disclose your findings, and will make every effort to acknowledge your contributions.

To report a security issue, please visit the [WordPress HackerOne](https://hackerone.com/wordpress) program.
