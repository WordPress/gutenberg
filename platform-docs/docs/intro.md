# Getting Started

Let's discover how to use the **Gutenberg Block Editor** to build your own block editor in less than 10 minutes**.


## What you'll need

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/download/) version 20.10 or above.
- We're going to be using "Vite" to setup our single page application (SPA) that contains a block editor. You can use your own setup, and your own application for this.

## Preparing the SPA powered by Vite.

First bootstrap a Vite project using `npm create vite@latest` and pick `React` variant and `JavaScript` as a language.

Once done, you can navigate to your application folder and run it locally using `npm run dev`. Open the displayed local URL in a browser.

## Installing dependencies

To build a block editor, you need to install the following dependencies:

 - `@wordpress/blocks`
 - `@wordpress/block-editor`
 - `@wordpress/block-library`
 - `@wordpress/components`

## Appease package expectations

The package `@wordpress/block-library` expects an env variable `IS_GUTENBERG_PLUGIN` to be defined. The quickest way to meet this requirement is to add it with `define` to the Vite config in `vite.config.js`. If using another bundler/build tool refer to its documentation for how to do this.

```js
import { defineConfig } from 'vite'
import react from '@vitejs/plugin-react'

// https://vitejs.dev/config/
export default defineConfig({
  // highlight-next-line
  define: { 'process.env.IS_GUTENBERG_PLUGIN': false },
  plugins: [react()],
})
```

## JSX

We're going to be using JSX to write our UI and components as the block editor is built with React. Using the Vite bootstrap described above thereâ€™s no need to configure anything as it outputs the result as a React pragma. If you're using a different bundler/build tool, you may need to configure the JSX transpilation to do the same.

## Bootstrap your block editor

It's time to render our first block editor. Update your `src/App.jsx` file with the following code:

```jsx
import { useState } from "react";
import {
  BlockEditorProvider,
  BlockCanvas,
} from "@wordpress/block-editor";
import { registerCoreBlocks } from "@wordpress/block-library";
import { getBlockTypes } from "@wordpress/blocks";

// Default styles that are needed for the editor.
import componentsStyles from "@wordpress/components/build-style/style.css?raw";
import blockEditorStyles from "@wordpress/block-editor/build-style/style.css?raw";
import blockEditorContentStyles from "@wordpress/block-editor/build-style/content.css?raw";

// Default styles that are needed for the core blocks.
import blocksCommonStyles from "@wordpress/block-library/build-style/common.css?raw";
import blocksStyles from "@wordpress/block-library/build-style/style.css?raw";
import blocksEditorStyles from "@wordpress/block-library/build-style/editor.css?raw";

const styles = `
  ${ componentsStyles }
  ${ blockEditorStyles }
  ${ blockEditorContentStyles }
  ${ blocksCommonStyles }
  ${ blocksStyles }
  ${ blocksEditorStyles }
`;

const registeredBlockTypes = getBlockTypes();
// Registers the default core block types, avoiding doing so again during HMR.
if (
  ! registeredBlockTypes.length ||
  ! registeredBlockTypes.some((blockType) => blockType.name.startsWith('core/'))
) registerCoreBlocks();

export default function Editor() {
  const [blocks, setBlocks] = useState([]);
  return (
    <>
      <style>{ styles }</style>
      {/*
        The BlockEditorProvider is the wrapper of the block editor's state.
        All the UI elements of the block editor need to be rendered within this provider.
      */}
      <BlockEditorProvider
        value={blocks}
        onChange={setBlocks}
        onInput={setBlocks}
      >
        {/*
          The BlockCanvas component renders the block list within an iframe
          and wires up all the necessary events to make the block editor work.
        */}
        <BlockCanvas height="500px" styles={ [ { css: styles } ] }/>
      </BlockEditorProvider>
    </>
  );
}
```

That's it! You now have a very basic block editor with several block types included by default: paragraphs, headings, lists, quotes, images...
