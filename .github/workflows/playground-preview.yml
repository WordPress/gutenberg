    # What and Why pull_request_target?
    #
    # The GitHub Actions built in environment variables and Context
    # of pull_request_target event are different from those of pull_request event.
    #
    # For example, the following environment variables and context are different.
    #
    # - event_name, GITHUB_EVENT_NAME
    # - ref, GITHUB_REF
    # - sha, GITHUB_SHA
    # - ref_name, GITHUB_REF_NAME
