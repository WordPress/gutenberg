    # Note: The pull_request_target event is used instead of pull_request because this workflow needs permission to comment
    # on the pull request. Because this event grants extra permissions to `GITHUB_TOKEN`, any code changes within the PR
    # should be considered untrusted. See https://securitylab.github.com/research/github-actions-preventing-pwn-requests/.
